        <p>Arriving in Xi'an, we were hoping the what we thought of the Chinese was
really just the Chinese of Beijing, and that outside it we will find the
people we were expecting. A nation that is spiritual, respectful of its elder
and of one another. Unfortunately we didn't find them in Xi'an. Instead we
found the same sort of people that were in Beijing. Rude, pushy, egoistic. It
really is a shame. Paula and I were really looking forward to our meeting with
the Chinese nation. We were disappointed we did not have the time to go to
rural China. Now, we are looking forward to leave the Chinese behind us. I am
sure there are very nice Chinese people (our hostel staff is a good example),
but for the most, they are just very rude people. I get more and more the
feeling that the greatness that came out of China is more the exception then
the rule. I wonder how Hong Kong will be like.</p>
