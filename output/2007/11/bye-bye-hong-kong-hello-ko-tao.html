        <p>It is not often that I feel as though my words are not enough, yet this is
exactly how I feel when I try to tell someone about Hong Kong. To describe
Hong Kong in words would be like trying to explain to a blind man why the
color red is much more vivid then gray. It is simply impossible. You can try,
but one has to see, one has to feel for one self before it is understood. This
all may sound a bit over dramatic but it is genuinely how I feel about Hong
Kong. The place, for me, has a certain magic, that cant really be described.
Cities have vibes, and Hong Kong's vibe is nothing short of magic. Watching
Hong Kong from Victoria Peak at night is not only breathtaking but also
romantic. For me it also feels me with pride. Look at this wonderful towers,
this show of beauty. Its all made by men. We made it, not nature. And that is
something very few places manage to do. The city feels like it was designed to
live in. It has air-walks, and parks, and trees all intertwined with huge
skyscrapers. There are butterflies and serious men in suites, rich and poor,
eastern and western, its just all there. There is charm to be found almost in
every corner we have seen. As wonderful as the time we had in Hong Kong was,
it was time to move along. After 5 wonderful days in Hong Kong, we boarded the
plane and flew to Bangkok. Our original plan was to go to the north of
Thailand, followed by Cambodia, and then finish in the south of Thailand. We
both were a bit tired after 3 weeks in China so we though a small stop at a
beach for a few days will be good. On the plane we decided to change a few
days at the beach to the diving course we were planning on doing anyway. We
chose Ko Tao as our destination. So here we are now on a tropical isle, about
to take our first shallow water dive today.
