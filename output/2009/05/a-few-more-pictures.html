        <p>This posts cover a few days worth of picture.</p>
<p>The 20/5 I took my camera with me to work to make some pictures of the vila
and its surrounding. This gate is the starting point of the path I jog on
regularly. The sun was just coming up, it was all really wonderful to watch.</p>
<p><img alt="The start of a path in the woods next to the DOP
villa" src="../../static/static/images/img_7650.jpg" /></p>
<p>The next picture is for the 21/5. That was a Thursday and Eran arrived for a
visit. Made a mas out of Aharale and Mine plans to go climbing in France.
Totally worth it though. Its great seeing Eran, which I have not seen for a
very long time.</p>
<p><img alt="Eran sitting in Oliver's garden" src="../../static/static/images/img_0038.jpg" /></p>
<p>The picture for the 22 is not dramatic. Unfortunately I have had little time
to actually take pictures that day, so I stuck the camera outside the living
room picture and snapped a few shots. <img alt="Plantsoen park from out apartment

<p>On Saturday the 23, Paula returned from her hiking vacation in the lake
district. While I was waiting for her ship to dock up, I came across this
sign. I just had to take a picture of it. Quite brilliant if you ask me.

<p>Today Ellen, Eran Paula and I went hiking in the dunes to the west of Den
Haag. It was a beautiful day and we really enjoyed the landscape. It changes
from city to forest to dunes to beach, all within a few km walk. I snapped
this in one of out breaks, just before we broke out of the forest and into the
dunes. I love the way the water and the light play with each other in this
picture. <img alt="Some play of water and light." src="../../static/static/images/img_7678.jpg" /></p>
