        <p>For a while my django project was set aside for other things. Last week I got
around to continue working on it. I have made a lot of progress and learned
quite a lot so I figured it was time for an update post. First and foremost a
beta version of the site is already online. I dont know if I wrote about what
it actually does so I'll start with that. Its a web application developed for
something me and my friends were missing. As a group we go on weekends away
quite often. Mostly climbing, mountan biking sonwoboarding or hiking. At the
end of every such weekend someone always needs to sit down and calculate
exactly how much each person payed and so caulcuate who needs to pay back who.
I figured it was time to be away with that, and I made "tripcalc" which is
ment to slove that. Everyone who payed something just fill it in and the web
app does the math and sends emails to people to let them know who they need to
pay to, or who are they getting money from. There were a lot of design
desicions I made which I am not sure if they were right or not, but that is
for another post. This one is about django, jQuery and deployment. Django has
really been a wonderful experience for me. There is rarely a day in which I
don't go "Wow that is just great, It can actually do that?!". There are a lot
of wonderful things in that framework. So with that say, let me get started.</p>
