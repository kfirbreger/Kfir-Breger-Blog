        <p>The first whiskey I ever drank was a Johnnie Walker Red Label. It was
horrible. Burned my mouth completely. I was, as can be expected young and knew
nothing about whiskey, aside form the name. And that it was apparently "cool"
to drink. So I tried. After that one sip I stayed of whiskey for over two
years. The second tim eI tasted whiskey, it was a Johnnie Walker Black label.
It was strong, burning, and delightful. I do not know what has changed in
those two years or if something changed at all. Maybe if I had tried the black
first instead of the red, I would be set right off the start. For the next
three years or so I only drank Johnnie Blacks. As my taste evolved I stated
trying more whiskeys. Like most people I started to value the single malts
more and more. Eventually completely abandoning the blended sorts, of which
Johnnie was my darling. Nowadays I have at home a small collection of singles,
out of which I drink a glass almost daily. Whiskey has definitely become my
favorite strong drink. Johnnie had a lot to do with it That is why I was so
delighted to see this 6 minute film over the history of Johnnie Walker. Even
if you are not a fan of the drink, or the brand, it is worth 6 minutes of your
time</p>
<p>Update: Unfortunatley the film was removed due to copy-write violations. quite
unfortunate</p>
