leather to seven when the alarm clock goes off. I am however not in need of
it's alarm. I am already wide awake. Today, Sunday the 27 of march 2011, is my
first race. Ever. I spent Saturday evening with Bas preparing my bike for the
race. We tuned the gears, oiled everything and after some thought decide on a
different tire setup. Nic for the front and Ralph for the rear. It's all dry
so this should be faster. I made sure I got to bed in time so I would get
enough sleep. That didn't quite go as plan. I was wide awake by the time the
alarm went off. I have no idea how long I have been lying in bed fully awake
and trying to relax. The ring of my alarm clock was the sound of freedom. It
was time to get started. My gear was already packed so I grabbed a healthy
breakfast loaded the car and was on my way. Even though I did my best to stay
calm it was hard not to feel excited. At times it was positive expectation, at
time a lot of fear for all sorts of horrible failure. Arriving in Wageningen I
took my time getting my number board (35) changing clothes and hanging the
board on my bike. In my attempt to stay calm and take it easy, I took so much
time that I no longer had time for a warmup lap. Here is thus my first lesson.
Taking your time is fine, but keeping an eye on the clock is just as
important. Because I was one of the first to register for the race I was in
the group that stone at the front. I knew I was not going to play with the
insane start sprint so my start position was good, but for me not ideal. I was
considering what to do to get out of the way as fast as I can when we were
told one minute to start. [caption id="attachment_16" align="alignnone"
width="512" caption="The start lineup at the front, with me right in the
middle"]<img alt="" src="../../static/static/images/IMG_38591.jpg" />[/caption] 30 seconds, 15 seconds, And
off we were. It was indeed crazy, people zipping by left and right, shoving
their bikes in front of me. I couldn't resist and started sprinting as well,
after about 100m I was able to reason with myself and calm down. Then I
sprinted again, then slowed, and back to sprint. It went like this for about 5
min. I was no longer being passed constantly and could calm myself into a
normal tempo. [caption id="attachment_17" align="alignnone" width="384"
caption="Geting into my own tempo"]<img alt="" src="../../static/static/images/P32788571.jpg" />[/caption] Getting my head straight I
focused on the trail. There was sand, lots of sand, at every corner. Good for
practice but a kill for my flow. Then all of a sudden I was finished with the
first round. I glance at my watch, and see I did it in just over 14 minutes.
Damn that's fast I think to myself. Average was suppose to be 18 minutes.
Little did I know the first round is somewhat shorter. [caption
id="attachment_18" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="Climbing
up"]<img alt="" src="../../static/static/images/P3279031.jpg" />[/caption] The round was quite nice. As
expected there was very little in the way of climbing, with only one short
steep climb. That is not to say that the track was flat. The track had a nice
ascent and descent flow to it which wasÂ  very entertaining. Despite all the
sand the the corners, i was getting more and more into a flow. Round two took
me 20 minutes. After an hour I was taken in by the leading group. I was
working as hard a I dared considering the time I still needed to cycle but I
was slowly realizing it was not fast enough. Tried as i did i couldn't really
accelerate. Whenever i tried to cycles somewhat faster i was getting really
tired really quick. Looking back at my round times it took me about an hour to
warm up and get comfy on the bike. Once there my time started to drop again.
[caption id="attachment_19" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="Sand and
big logs made for some tricky cornering"]<img alt="" src="../../static/static/images/P3279133.jpg" />[/caption] Unfortunately it wasn't
enough. Just before the second hour I was taken once more by the leading
group. This led to me being able to ride only 7 rounds placing me far in the
back of the field. Crosing the finish line, my legs were feeling tired but my
back was killing me. Might be time to switch to a fully. I ended up 204 from
245 overall and 42 from 44 in the masters +30. Considering this is my first
race I guess finishing better then a fifth of the participants is quite good.
Still I was hoping for more. Looking back at the result I was able to score
much better if I was about a minute and a half faster each round. One thing is
clear though. I need to get faster, fast. I stayed around for the 75 minutes
race to cheer on Bas, Tim and Bob. Bas registered somewhat late and therefore
started way in the back. He did his best to catch up with Tim and Bob. Bob
however had other plans. He got a flat tire after 35 min and was out. Tim with
a great finish managed to stay just ahead of Bas. While cheering my mates
there was a big crash right in front of me. Two rides, and flying bicycles.
Sometimes things can get ugly. [caption id="attachment_21" align="alignnone"
width="456" caption="Me and some other spectators, helping crashed
riders"]<img alt="" src="../../static/static/images/IMG_4920.jpg" />[/caption] Using the bike to get to work
is a great way for me to train. However just cycling there is definitely not
enough. I need to add intervals to that ride as to improve my speed. My next
race is the Kellerwald marathon, the first RWP Cup race and I plan on
delivering a better result. I have three weeks to improve my speed. Here's
hoping I manage to. &amp;nbsp_place_holder;</p>
