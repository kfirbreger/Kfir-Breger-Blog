<p>The 13 of february I rode for the first time in months a proper tour. With the
racing season coming closer by, it was a good chance to see how much all the
winter training had helped.</p>
<p>For the not dutch among you, Brabant is one of the provinces in the
Netherlands. This being the Netherlands means that the highest point is 60m.
Its more of a hill then anything else, although for dutch XC tracks, its
pretty high. The tour had a good mixture of technical single track and simple,
recovery flats. There were some minor climbs and descents, but aside from the
roof, nothing really big.</p>
<p>After all the spinning I did through the winter I was expecting to be very
fast. I wasn't. It took me just over 3 hours to finish the 50 km tour. That is
slower than I ever was. At first this really got me down. It seed that all the
training has only made me slower. After getting home and thinking more about
it I tend to think that I was so slow more thanks to the fact that it was 90%
mud more then that training has made me slow. It was also a good wake up call</p>
<p><img alt="Yours truely at the tour" src="../../static/static/images/IMG_5132.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not knowingly it seems I was expecting after just 8 months of training to be
as fast as the leading group. Somehow, in my subconscious, I got myself
convinced I was already prime spot material. Quite unrealistic of me, and its
good that it surfaced now and not at an actually competition. I need, it
seems, a reminder of what my realistic expectations are for this season,
otherwise I risk getting overtrained.</p>
