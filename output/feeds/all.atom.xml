Solr does not dynamically load the file. As long as no action is taken, the
old schema will still be in effect. After updating the schema.xml you can
either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart SOLR or Tomcat (depending on your configuration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reload the core that will use the new schema
Relaoding the core can be done using the reload action:
&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=RELOAD&amp;amp;core=core0&lt;/code&gt; Where core0
is the core you want to restart. You can visit the cores page to make sure the
core is successfully restarted.&lt;/li&gt;

behind on the code if I need to solve some problem or continue developing.
Doing this manually is not practical, and so I created a bash script to
refresh all my repositories. While I was at it I added a starting command for
the apache and mysql. Since I do not desire to start them if they are already
running, the script check first if they are already running. Writing this
script I learned a lot about shell scripting. Here are some of the things I
picked up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding -x to the shebang will make bash output everything that is going on,
helps with debugging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a variable as a parameter to a function, if you just give the variable
name it will be treated as a string value and that will be passed to the
function. I ended up encapsulating it as &lt;code&gt;"${var}"&lt;/code&gt; since the value was a
string. If your value is not a string you probably need some other solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing a variable to a string is best achieved with the following syntax:
&lt;code&gt;if[ "${var}" = "foo" ]; then&lt;/code&gt; Notice the space between the brackets and the
values inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using grep to pick something out of a list of processes requires an extra step
in which you remove the grep itself from the list. &lt;code&gt;ps -e | grep -v grep |
grep searchstring&lt;/code&gt; Otherwise grep might find its own search process, which is
of course not the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will save you some time in scripting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bash"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="script"></category><category term="shell"></category><category term="tips"></category><category term="unix"></category></entry><entry><title>Drupal 7 phantom block</title><link href="//2011/12/drupal-7-phantom-block.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-02T11:04:44+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/12/drupal-7-phantom-block.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I can across an interesting change in the way Drupal 7 handles blocks
created via modules. In a module I made, I defined a block using the
&lt;em&gt;hook_block_info&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hook_block_view&lt;/em&gt;. This block was added to the site's
front page. After some implementation details changed it became apparent that
the current block was not what was needed but a whole series of other blocks.
Both hooks were completely rewritten to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the &lt;em&gt;hook_block_view&lt;/em&gt; was called one to many times. Looking at
the front page, I saw that the, now removed block was still there. The block
admin page, however, did not show it. This was to be expected as there was no
info available for it. It was possible to configure the block though. Either
through typing the correct url, or through the small gear on the top right
side of that block. Both clearing the cache and turning the module on and off
have failed to remove this phantom block, which had no implementation but was
still around. Deinstalling the module was the only way to clear it out of the
block table (aside forma custom sql query of course). Since my module did not
have any custom information in the database this was not a problem. However if
your module does have such information, deinstalling it will remove all that
data. Since my module was available for deinstallation leads me the believe
that this is by design. Keep this in mind when building your modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after the block has been removed from the blocks table, it was still
visible. Further research led to the &lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt; module. The block was added
to the display via a context reaction, and it seems that context does not
check if a block is still available. And so the &lt;em&gt;hook_block_view&lt;/em&gt; of my module
was called with the delta of the old, non-existing, block. Opening the
reaction interface for context does not show that the block is part of it,
because, I assume, it is not defined. In the database however it is still
present. Saving the context with the phantom block without making any changes
does remove it from the database, and has removed it from the front page as
well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blocks"></category><category term="bug"></category><category term="context"></category><category term="drupal"></category><category term="drupal 7"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Been out jogging</title><link href="//2011/10/been-out-jogging.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-10T22:41:45+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/10/been-out-jogging.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since the last time I went for a run.

Finish the Eiger Challenge and finish a
marathon at the top 50%. Last month I finished the Eiger Challenge. As I
wrote, it was a close call, but I did it. So that left the second target,
finishing on the top half. With two marathons left for me this season, I
needed to make it happen soon. For GRG I was joined by Marijn. It is always
good to go ride with people that are faster then you since it really helps on
motivation. Marijn has been a serious sporter for some time now and so we
spent most of our ride talking about cycling, rowing, nutrition and, of
course, women. After almost running out of gas on the way to Malmedy, we
arrived at the starting area. Coming to Godefroy, I was feeling confident. I
was getting used to my Liteville, and I was fit and highly motivated. The
organisation was not that well. Less so then I expected, We did manage to find
the tent with the number boards and ate some pasta before hitting the sack.
The weather was expected to be bad. And it was. Luckily, I cam prepared this
time. Swapping my Ralphs for a Fat Albert and a Nobby Nic. Marijn was running
Nics front and rear. Standing at the starting area, it was already raining. It
took Marijn about 20 seconds to disappear into the distance. I won't see him
again until after the race. The begining of the course was not really muddy,
and I began to question my decision to go for tires with big nobs. Then the
rain got intense. The course was getting muddier and I was getting colder. By
the 30km line. I was happy I went for nobs. At the 42km feeding station, they
were handing out warm soup. Being soaked to the bone and cold, warm soup
tastes fantastic. I didn't care it took 10 min from my time. I needed to warm
up. After about 60km the sky cleared up and I could ride the rest of the race
in somewhat sunny weather. I was feeling good about my riding time, and it
turns out I was right. 108 from 240 overall and 38 from 82 in the Masters 1
class. Target met.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="marathon"></category><category term="Marathon"></category><category term="mtb"></category><category term="race"></category></entry><entry><title>Eiger Challenge</title><link href="//2011/08/eiger-challenge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-25T11:20:40+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/08/eiger-challenge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was it, the big one. What I have been looking for all season. Even though
it is not the last season of the race, and is not included in any cup or
championship I am participating in, it was what I had set as my main target.
This is the real deal. Mountain biking in actual mountains. And there are few
places in the world with as famous, or beautiful, mountains as Berner
Oberland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eiger Trail" src="/static/images/eigertrail.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to go 4 men strong. Then Erwin broke his arm, Tim his
kneecap and Sophia realized she just does not have the time. So here I was on
friday 13 of august sitting alone in my car on the way to Switzerland. And I
was glowing with joy. Because I was going to Switzerland, to ride my new
mountain bike, that I got two days before. In view of the Eiger. This was
happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet I was also worried. There was a time limit set for the 88 km race. The
course was basically a big loop and a small loop. To be able to continue to
the small loop, you had to pass back through Grindelwald within 6 hours and 15
min from start. This mention I had to be way faster then I ever was in a
marathon. The distance, 54km was not that long. However there were around
2700hm in that distance. That alone is more then I have ever done in a race.
An then there were the extra 1200hm waiting on the other side of the time
limit, which I needed to do if I managed to make the time limit. You can see
why I was worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The day before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I wanted to get to know some of the course and also to get to know my
new bike. Like I said I just got it two days before so I was still not
completely comfortable with it. Looking at the course I decided to take the
bus up to Grosse Scheidegg, thereby skipping the first 1000hm climb, and head
out from there. On the way up I saw some bikers practicing the climb. Respect
for whoever climbs that much the dat before a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Grosse Scheidegg" src="/static/images/grossescheidegg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Grosse Scheidegg the course goes to First, then down and back up.
Somewhere after First I lost the actual race course. And frankly it was a good
thing because I ended up on this awesome singletrack that was keeping me happy
for a long while. Eventually it ended and since I could see no more signs for
the race, realized I have gone of course. Luckily I spotted someone marking
the course further down and he sent back on the right track. After a short
hike up the mountain, which I will end up cycling down the day afterwards, I
was back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rode for a while more until I started feeling my legs. It was time to call
it a day and head back to camp. My legs will have all the exercise they will
need tomorrow. Descending to Grindelwald was great fun. I rarely get a chance
to descend over 1000hm in one go. Quite enjoyable. After a shower and a visit
to the pasta party (yey energy) It was time for the bed. Lying in my sleeping
bag I was going over the track for one last time. Opening with Grosse
Scheidegg 1000hm climb at 9%. A climb to Feld, A climb to Bort that is 25%.
After Bort its a descend all the way to Grindelwald for the time limit and
then the last long climb to Kleine Scheidegg, 1000hm at 9%. I figured I need
to be at the top of Grosse Schiedegg within 2 hours to make the time limit.
Setting the alarm to 5:15 in the morning, I went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Race day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting out of my tent, the moon was shining above Kleine Scheidegg, giving
the world a silvery glow. I could not have imagined a more beautiful start for
the day. I gathered my stuff, got my bag ready and headed to the finish zone,
where breakfast was served. It is not often that I eat spaghetti for
breakfast, for today I made an exception. In the meantime I was starting to
feel the excitement combined with fear I feel often before a race. This time
there somewhat more fear because of the time limit. Not helpful I know but I
couldn't help myself. It didn't help that I go the number 23, which means I
was starting at the front, with all the really fast people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start zone was downhill, which was good because I got to relax a bit on
the bike and get everything going nice and easy. I got into the first box 5
min before start. I locked both suspensions as I knew it was going to be 11 km
of climbing on asphalt and I intended to be as efficient as I could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Start" src="/static/images/eigerchallenge-" title="start.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be expected the start was a sprint. It does not matter how often I tell
myself I am not going to sprint at the start, somehow I get carried away and
do sprint the first 500m or so before I get myself under control. I got passed
by most of the field right of the start, but I tried not to care. I was here
to finish, not to win. The climbing started through Grindelwald and I was
settling on a nice pace. We were out of Grindelwald, and I was going with a
group I suspected would climb at my speed. Then this guy told me my rear wheel
looked kinda empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he was right. I stopped to pomp it. Next to me stopped an man whom I think
was mid 60s and looking very fit. He asked if I needed help and I told him
that no, I was fine, Then I disconnected my pomp and the ventil went with it
and all the air was out of my binnenband in 2 seconds. "Bloody france ventils"
I cursed. Luckily the older guy had a pomp that clams instead of screws on, so
I was able to pomp it back up. Before I was ready to go I had already lost
about 10 min to this. by this time everybody was past me and I was dead last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man was not in the race, but likes doing the climb with the racers,
and so we started climbing together. He was clearly a better climber then me.
I refused to let a man almost double my age get away from me so I was pushing
myself harder then I planned to, and he was clearly holding back so, so that
we could climb together, passing a few racers on the way up. I was at the
Grosse Scheidegg 1:20 after start. Way better then I dared hope. I was
starting to be confident in me making the time limit. Saying goodbye to the
old chap, I spent another 10 min pumping up my rear tire to acceptable level.
Then it was of to First. This part I already knew as I did it the day before,
so I had more time to look around. Berner Oberland is just beautiful. I did
notice that even though I was pushing myself harder, I was not faster then
yesterday when I was taking it easy. The climb to Grosse Scheidegg was already
taking its toll on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working through it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eiger Challenge" src="/static/images/eigerchallenge-k1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the descent from First was super technical, and like most people,
I walked most of it. I think that with some more riding time on my Liteville I
will be able to cycle down such technical terrain. The next few km where fire
roads, gravel and some singletrack, all of it beautiful. Then I came to the
climb up to Feld. The path up seemed to go on and on. I was already starting
to feel the race in my legs and for the first time this race, I stopped and
walked some of the part. I came across two kids offering sponges with water to
cool of. Here I was on a mountain side, no building in site and these two 6
year old kids are here to help. I was moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I was not moving fast enough. About half the climb up to Feld I
did walking. At the top I met another 88km contester and we cycled on
together. Going down from Feld was fun and technical. What a wonderful descent
it was. A shame that this trail is closed the rest of the year as I am sure it
will draw quite a crowd. Even going down I was not going as fast as I hoped,
mostly due to just how technical everything was. The course was going mostly
downwards with here and there some short climbs of 20-60hm (guessing here).
Then we hit the 25% climb to Bort. Guess what, everybody was walking it. by
now I was surrounded by people doing the 55km, that has started an hour later,
but had time to catch up as their course did not include the climb up to Feld.
It was a long, steep walk up to Bort. I made the top there and looked at my
watch. 5:15. I had a full hour for what I remembered was pretty much all the
way down. Pff, easy. Only it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route was going down, with a lot of small climbs on the way. It felt like
for each 20m descent there was a 10m climb. This part also had the most
singletrack in it. Which is great, unless you really want to make time. Every
time I stared on the descent I was getting all optimistic, and with every
climb I was doubting I would make the time limit. I glanced at my watch again.
6 hours flat. I had a quarter of an hour to go and no idea how much further I
had to go, and in front of me was 10m, 20% climb. At this point, I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eiger challenge" src="/static/images/eigerchallenge-k3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pace went down, and I was preparing for failure. Then I heard Paula's voice
in my head telling me how I give up just before it actually matter. "Not this,
time", I told myself, "You are going to stop trying when the timer hits 6:15
and not a second earlier.". So I gave it all I got. I attacked everything.
Uphill, downhill, corners. I was giving it everything I had. Seven minutes
later coming out of the woods, I passed two regulators. One of them looked at
his watch and called, "8 minutes!". " I know!", I answered going as fast as I
could. Then I was on asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting in the highest gear I had, I was going full speed. A guy from the
55km, saw, me coming, and saw that I was from the 88km race so he got in front
of me to break my wind. I was very thankful. Then I saw it, the sign for the
88km to go left. I look left, and the road was closed. "NO!", I looked at my
watch, 6:10 I still had 5 min. Only then did it register in my mind that at
the bottom of the sign it said 150m. I was sprinting again full of hope, and
yes, 150 meters latter, with 5 minutes left I took the corner and started on
the climb to Kleine Scheidegg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eiger Challenge" src="/static/images/eigerchallenge-k5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another 11km long, 1000hm climb. This one half asphalt, half gravel. I
half walked the way up I think. I was tired, my legs hurt and I was feeling
nauseous. Nevertheless, I kept going. on the way up, I even passed someone.
Its good that you can see Kleine Scheidegg from about 2/3 of the way as it
helps with motivation. As I was approching I saw the people in the post were
folding their tent, and again fear struck me. Was I too slow? did I climb all
this way just to be disqualified. Luckily, they were early, I still had 15min
on the time limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing the highest point I knew it was almost all down from here, with 2-3
short climbs. The way down was fast. At the climbs I took no chances and
attacked as hard as I could. The course kept going down, and down. Grindelwald
was in sight! Almost there. Almost. Then I was in Grindelwald. Coming in at
the bottom of the village, there was just one climb left, that to the finish.
Up I went. Passing the finish line after 9 hours and 12 seconds. To me, it
felt like I won the race. After just one year of cycling, I finished this very
challenging race. Even now, a week later, I still feel like I won.&lt;/p&gt;

I do however, always want to change the settings when going full screen. For
some more geek credit, I go for a bigger font and a good old fashion system

Three marathons in one month. I have yet to
ride with such intensity and was excited and worried about it. This will
really test my physical and mental skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ardennes Trophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up was the &lt;a href="http://www.ardennes-trophy.be/"&gt;Ardennes Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, an RWP cup
marathon in Theux. This will be my first return to the Ardennes since the
Houffamarathon of 2010, the first marathon I have ridden. I have been in the
ardennes before and knew this will be a challenge. Unlike the german
marathons. Ardennes marathons have steep technical climbs on single tracks.
This makes climbing an order of magnitude harder then german marathons. And as
I said before, climbing is my biggest weakness. Physical was going to be a
challenge then. Mentally I thought this will be easier. The Ardennes are quite
beautiful, and I was expecting to be riding singletracks for most of the
marathon. That always makes it easier for me to stay motivated. All that
beautiful sights around helps me to stay motivated and to remember why I am
doing this. Also, I had the great pleasure of sharing this weekend with Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ardennen Trophy" src="/static/images/sportograf-19134144.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim is an experienced marathon rider, having been doing this a few seasons
now. In the car on the way to the fabulous glamping L'Escargot we had time to
talk about racing, tactics and other bike stuff. Tim was displeased with his
last marathon and was looking forward to see how this marathon would be like.
Tim told me how he plans he's marathon, and I wanted to try it out. It is
quite different then how I have, till now, paced myself, so it would be
interesting to see how it all went. After making sure the bikes were ready for
the race, and eating our bowls of pasta we went to bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weatherman predicted rain, and a somewhat cold day. Luckily weathermen can
be wrong. The day did begin chilly but it was warming up to around 17 degrees,
and even though the sky was mostly grey, here and there were blue spots. Just
perfect. Tim had chosen to ride the half marathon (70km, 1800hm) and I was
going for the full one (90km, 2400hm), so I was starting an half hour before
Tim. Around 5 minutes before the start, I took my place at the starting grid.
These moments are for me the hardest. Everything is focused on riding, but I
am not going anywhere. I try to keep my heart rate down, and it is working
somewhat. Clicking in, last check that everything is in order and we are off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is as usual a climb. This helps spread the riders, and make the
transition to the singletrack easier. After 10km Tim coms zipping buy. "Damn
that guy is fast" I think to myself as we throw an hello at one another. I
won't see Tim again for a few hours. The course was technically challenging,
as I expected it to be. It was also great fun. The hardest part was the
finish, and not for the usual reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following's Tim advise, I increased my pace at the last 10 km. I was passing
people as the finish line came closer and closer. I knew it was not far
anymore and even though I was feeling tired, I kept my pace. And there it was,
the last descent. I could see the village just bellow me, I went full speed
down, passing the 90km sign. "Thats it", I thought, I am finished. I came out
of the singletrack into the road, and right across into one heck of a climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ardennen Trophy" src="/static/images/sportograf-19151019.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wasn't ready for this. I was expecting to be finished after the
descent. I was exhausted, and I was not going to give up. So I got my chest
down to my handlebar and went for it. Behind me I could three guys trying to
decide if they were going for an end sprint. "Don't you dare", I was saying to
them in my head. Either they didn't, or I was to fast, either way, they didn't
pass me. Coming out of the woods to the finish plato I saw the guy in front of
me was just 20 meters ahead. I head 250 meters to go. "I am going to get
him!". Hammering the pedals, ignoring the pain in my legs, I passed him just
before the finish. Tim, Marian and Coen were waiting to congratulate me for
finishing. Tim got me a beer and a hot dog. It tasted like heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the car back we talked about the race. Tim was also pleased with his
result. It was a successful weekend for us both. We also talked future plans,
which, as it turns out was really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raid Des Hautes Fagnes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RDHF" src="/static/images/rdhf1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing a marathon, doing anything less then the full distance makes me
feel like I am taking the easy route. So, when registering for the
&lt;a href="http://rdhf.be"&gt;RDHF&lt;/a&gt;, I naturally registered for the 115km. I was not aware
of the reputation this marathon has for being difficult and technical. Talking
in the car on the way back to from the Ardennes Trophy, Tim told me he never
did the 115km and was quite impressed with me choosing to do that. Which got
me worried. If Tim, who is definitely a better mountain biker, decided not to
do it, can I do it? Eventually I decided to switch to the 90km, mostly because
the week afterwards I was going to ride the Allersheimer marathon, an RWP cup
race. In retrospective, it was a very good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before the race Paula and me rode to Belgium. I was so happy that
Paula joined me. With me gone quite a lot for marathons in Germany and Belgium
it was fun for her to join so that she would understand more what actually
happens on such a weekend. We chose to sleep at the same camping I did with
Tim for the Ardennen Trophy and again it was great. Sunday morning we woke up
early and headed for the starting area. Paula was quite surprised by the
amount of people there, She was really excited to see that many people, all
sharing a passion for mountain bike marathons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RDHF" src="/static/images/rdhf2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, for this race I got an Epic 29er as a test bike.
For me this is the first time riding a 29er, and I was quite curious to see
how it feels to ride. I loved the epic elite I tested a few weeks ago and so
was having high expectations for the ride. After a short warm up I kissed
Paula for luck and got to the start zone. Having Paula there at the start was
great. Feeling more excited then usually I started on the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an amazing marathon this is. The race starts with a climb, Like it most
marathons. However, it quickly became clear that this is no normal marathon.
Lots of single tracks, most of them quite technical. The numbers were similar
to the Ardennen trophy, 90km, 2200hm. The actual situation was quite
different. The route here was a lot more technical. Some parts were completely
impossible to ride. the rest was never easy. It felt almost relentless in its
technicality. Loose your concentration and you crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RDHF" src="/static/images/rdhf-finish.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Epic 29er was proving to be quite an interesting ride. It does
roll over obstacles a lot easier, which is good. Then again turning it feels
like trying to turn a heavy truck, which is bad. At the of the day I just
couldn't like it as much as I liked the elite. Once you get accustomed to it,
I can believe it will be faster then the elite. What this bike did not have
was joy. It was full of seriousness I do not feel when riding my mountain
bike. At the end of the day I just couldn't like it. Back to the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was beautiful. Probably the most beautiful ride I had in the Ardennen so
far. And it was exciting and challenging and hard. Crossing a river then going
under an old bridge, going through beautiful forests, it was the an
experience. It took me an hour longer to finish and I was much much more tired
then the Ardennen trophy. Next year, I am coming back, better prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allersheimer Marathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, a week after the RDHF was this RWP cup marathon. If you have not
heard of this one, I wouldn't be surprised. Its a small scale marathon in
north germany. Tim and Marijn went for the half marathon (one round), while I
went for the full one (two rounds). For me, this was one to forget. The course
was muddy, and boring, the weather was cold and rainy. I came somewhat
unprepared for this condition. My wind jacket was not enough to keep me dry
and so 2 hours in I was completely soaked. Even worse prepared was my bike. I
was still using 2.1 racing ralphs from the last marathon. The RR might be a
brilliant racing tire, but in the mud it just doesnt work. I was sliding all
over the place. Grip was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and Marijn did quite well, both finishing quite high on the RWP cup class.
As for me, well I was still tired from the RDHF, I got lost on the way, which
costed my 20 minutes, I didn't eat enough, and I ended up finish dead last,
DNF not included. For the first time. My motivation was at an all time low. I
did however, learned to pay better attention to the expected conditions and to
come prepare. This may sound obvious yet somehow it escaped me. Sometimes you
have to learn the hard way I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: Epic 29er review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I rode the RDHF on an Epic 29er thanks to &lt;a href=""&gt;Jurriaan&lt;/a&gt; who
arranged the test bike. I have never ridden a 29er before, and so was curious
as to see what its like. Before the race I did some laps on it and was very
impressed. I even told my wife just before the start "This is the best bike I
have ever ridden". Things however are not as simple as they first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still I want to start with a short technical overview. The has a somewhat
different setup from the Epic Elite I tested. The rear uses a through axle,
and uses SRAM X-9 instead of Shimano's XTR. The fork is a RockShox Reba and
not a SID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Epic 29er" src="/static/images/epic29er.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take you through the points which are the 29ers advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining speed - A bigger wheel maintains its momentum better, making it less hard to maintain speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obstacle engagement - A bigger wheel has a better attack angle for obstacles, making it much easier to roll over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not notice a real advantage in maintaing speed, though I am sure that
the physics are correct. I definitely felt a difference in rolling over
obstacles. It makes a much bigger difference then you would think. I noticed
it mostly while descending. Going down at high speeds, it was possible to
easily attack rocks and roots, that would normally take effort en braking,
with little speed loss. Also going down stairs is easier, with the bigger
wheel. There are however certain downsides to the 29er:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less nimble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavier part as not true for me as my Rockhopper is heavier then the Epic
29er. For me it was a lighter bike then I am used to. The nimbleness I did
notice. A lot. I am, as of now, not that skilled of a biker yet. It may very
well be so that if you are really good at handling your bike, that you will
notice this much less, or will be able to compensate with your own body. I,
however was not able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day. Event though it did perform well in the race (I doubt
if I would have finished it on my Rockhopper), I just couldn't like the bike.
It felt like an efficient, heartless bike. I can see why you would choose this
bike. It's just not for me. It takes a lot of the fun out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="marathon"></category><category term="Marathon"></category><category term="mtb"></category><category term="race"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>The finer points of respondsToSelector</title><link href="//2011/05/the-finer-points-of-respondstoselector.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-27T13:46:33+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/05/the-finer-points-of-respondstoselector.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cocoa's object model is something I really like. Coming from Java, being able
to declare a property and have the getters and setters auto generated is
really wonderful. The key value way to interact with an object is also a very
powerful tool. The problem is what happens when these two collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a project at work I needed to parse some XML. The xml contained several
entries of entries. Only part of the information given for each entry was
actually needed by the software. Therefor the object used did not have a
property for each field in the entry. Just doing the follow code will not
work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[currentObject setValue:(id)elemValue forKey:objProperty];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will raise an exception as soon as an attempt is made to set a property
that does not exist. Wrapping the setter in a check to see if the object has
this property will solve this problem. Using responseToSelector a test can be
made to see if the object reacts to a selector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ([currentObject responseToSelector:NSSelectorFromString(objProperty)]) {
[currentObject setValue:(id)elemValue forKey:objProperty]; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should do it. Except it doesn't completely. If your object has a function
that is named like objProperty, responseToSelector will return true, because
your object does response to it. Its just not a property that is set-able, but
instead, a method. Actually, reponseToSelector only controls for function.
Since synthesizing a property creates a method with the name of the property,
it works for detecting properties as well. To avoid getting an exception on
setting values for keys. Make sure that objProperty does not contain a value
equal to a method in currentObject that does not represent a property.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cocoa"></category><category term="os x"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>NSXMLParser and error code 4</title><link href="//2011/05/nsxmlparser-and-error-code-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-25T11:31:22+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/05/nsxmlparser-and-error-code-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I had one of the strangest bugs I have seen to date. I am working on an
iOS app that does  a lot of communication with a web app api. the
communication is done via XML. Since the web app requires autherntication, I
am useing specific requests and placing the response xml in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSXMLParser requires a NSData object to init with data. Following the
conversion cod eI found on Apple's site I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSData *xmlData = [NSData dataWithBytes:[xml
dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] length:[xml
lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing the xmlData through to the parser ended in me getting an error 4,
which means document empty. I tried everything. Printed out the xml string to
see it was full, compared length of data and string, releasing the parser.
Still error 4. For the heck of it I tried giving the parser a nil for data.
That gave an error 5. Trying to give an empty NSData object also gave error
code 4. After 3 hours spent in google and stack overflow I was not even a
small step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn't know what to do when, while scanning all these pages I saw a
piece of code of converting the string to data without giving the length. for
the heck of it I decided to try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSData* xmlData = [xml dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you know it worked. No idea why. Naturally. I wanted to know what the
length of the data object was now. I was fully expecting it to be bigger than
original. To my surprise it was the same length as the string. The same length
I was giving it in the first call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this now wrks I have no idea. The first and the second calls should give
the same results, yet somehow they don't. If you got this problem, then
converting without giving the function a length. Good luck and happy
programming.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cocoa"></category><category term="ios"></category><category term="objective c"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="xml"></category></entry><entry><title>Epic Elite 2011 Review</title><link href="//2011/05/epic-elite-2011-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-18T21:50:06+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/05/epic-elite-2011-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my hunt for a new bike, the Epic from specialized is high on the list. I
was lucky enough to secure a test bike from &lt;a href="bikeshop.nl"&gt;bikeshop&lt;/a&gt; in
Amersfoort. My current bike is a 2007 Specialized Rockhopper, which is a hard
tail. This test was also my first full suspension experience as well as the
first time I rode a 2X10 and I will keep that in mind during the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.specialized.com/zz/en/bc/SBCProduct.jsp?spid=52788&amp;amp;scid=
1000&amp;amp;scname=Mountain"&gt;Epic&lt;/a&gt; is Specialized's marathon/xc bike. Quoting Specialized
website the Epic is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2011 Epic Elite" src="/static/images/2011" title="-Epic-Elite.jpg" /&gt; Whether hammering technical World Cup XC courses or local
trails, the Epic is built to be super light, fast, and efficient for explosive
climbing ability and nimble handling. With patented FSR and Brain technology,
the Epic was engineered for the race course but is remarkably adept at
gobbling up singletrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am doing mostly marathons I figured trying to ride a dedicated bike might
be a good experience. The Epic is mostly meant for climbing therefor, I needed
a course with as much climbing as possible, but I also wanted a as large as
possible a variety in terrain. I eventually settled on the following plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeddam - As much climbing as you can do in NL outside of Limburg. Not so technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winterswijk - There was a new, short technical course open which even has a rock garden
Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amerongen - Technical at some points, flowing at others. Fun climbs and descents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This covered pretty much all that I wanted to test considering the time I had
available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pre-ride impression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bike is light. Coming from my Rockhopper it felt incredibly light. The
second thing that I noticed is how the whole bike feels like one unit and not
like a collection of parts. There is a genuine wholeness to it that radiates
confidence. Generally speaking I like the look of the bike, though the
heightened bar makes it look less sporty(more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Epic in the car" src="/static/images/Epic-" title="in-the-car.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zeddam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first ride on the Epic. I was impressed. A lot. Right off the
start the bike felt really fast. The first part of the route can be seen as a
warmup. It is mostly flat, giving me enough time to get the feeling of the
bike. As the route progressed it became clear this bike is fast. I was
climbing faster then I expected and on the descent I was not only faster but
also had much more confidence handling the bike. The first descent on the
route has a few grooves in it and ends at a somewhat sharp left turn. Despite
this being my first ride on this bike I was going faster down and entered the
corner a lot faster then I dared on my trusty Rockhopper. I do realize that a
lot of this has to do with the bike being a full suspension bike. However,
giving me such a feeling of control and confidence is probably not only do to
the bike being a fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Epic components" src="/static/images/epic-" title="components.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2x10 system did take some getting used to. I did not feel like I was
missing gears, but I did need to work more with the front derailleur. For some
reason Specialized chose to use the SRAM X7 for the front derailleur. It
disappoints. Changing gear is slow and noisy even when the system is not under
pressure. Installing a 2x10 system with a medium quality front derailleur does
not work that well. The Shimano XTR rear derailleur was brilliant. Even under
pressure it would just switch fast and quietly. I believe that opting for the
X9 as a front derailleur would have made changing gears that much more
enjoyable. The shifters, Shimano SLX, work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Epic brakes" src="/static/images/epic-" title="brakes.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me finish the group review by talking about the brakes. The bike comes
equip with Avid Elixir R SL. 160mm at the rear and 180mm at the front(L model.
The M and S models have 160mm at the front). On my Rockhopper I have 180mm
front and back. I did not, however, felt any shortage of braking power. Far
from it. The brakes were strong precise and had a great feeling to then.
Unless you needed to break hard. The front brake seemed to change its power
all of a sudden. When breaking hard there seemed to be a point, at which,
pulling the lever even more will give a burst of stopping power that caused me
to be almost thrown out of the saddle. Even when I knew it was coming, it was
still hard to feel when exactly that point is, or to use more feelings to
avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going faster then I did on my Rockhopper. What impressed me most was
that confident feeling the bike gives. The geometry on the Epic is sharper
than what I am used to, the front more nervous and yet here I was going faster
then before. Normally those things don't go hand in hand. Good work
specialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing on the Epic does feel like biking on a hard tail. Specialized brain
technology works. Whenever I would hit something that required some suspension
work, there would be a distinct 'tick' as the brain would let go and the bike
would response to the terrain. It does take getting used to. The first 3-4
times I thought it was a snakebite on my rear tire. Once I got used to it I
barely noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through the route, the bike just kept on impressing. Going down fast,
going up fast, technical climbs were easier to do and cornering was not only
faster but also more enjoyable. The whole ride was very enjoyable. Getting
back to my car I looked at my watch and couldn't believe what I saw. I was a
full 20% faster on this bike then I was on my Rockhopper. That is a big
difference on a 25km track. It seems that it not only feels fast, but it is
actually fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Test bike at Winterswijk" src="/static/images/Winterswijk.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Winterswijk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a new short mountain bike track open in Winterswijk and since I was
close by I decided to go check it out. It was apparently technically
interesting and I knew it had a rock garden, so it was a good place to test
the Epic on the more technical stuff. The trail slings up and down a hill,
using as much of the hillside as possible. Lots of pinhead corners, and full
of short descents and climbs. The Epic took most of it with a stride. And what
didn't go so well has, I suspect, more to do with my skills then the bike. The
rock garden was also easily absorbed by the suspensions. The bike turns
sharply and the somewhat upright sitting position did help throw the bike
through the corners. In a marathon though, these type of sections are rare so
a lower more racy position will probably be overall better. Since I was never
here with my hardtail, I had no time comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Amerongen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I packed both my Rockhopper and the Epic and headed for
Amerongen together with Jurriaan. Jurriaan has been riding fullys for a while
now and was therefor in a much better position to determine if the previous
day's time improvements were do to the bike being a fully or to the bike
itself. I was still having a hard time believing I was 20% faster so for today
I was going to start on my Rockhopper, do a lap of the trail and then do the
same lap on the Epic. Starting with my Rockhopper meant I couldn't use "Well I
was tired" to explain the time differences. Jurriaan started on the Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technical problem aside, the lap was just a regular Amerongen lap. A good
trail, fun, and with some nice technical parts in it. Oh and ending with a big
climb. Jurriaan will not tell me what he thought of the bike as to not
influence me (Thanks Jurriaan). He did make some slight adjustments to the
suspensions and the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off I was on the Epic, while Jurriaan was back on his Giant. Once again I was
going way faster. The Epic was feeling even better after Jurriaan's
adjustments and the breaks have lost that unexpected extra bite. In Amerongen
there is a part of the route which is going down in a winding singletrack with
lots of roots and small holes. The epic was eating it all up. I barely felt
the seat moving. The bike felt stable, fast and I had a lot of confidence.
Cornering, even on loose sand felt good and I was caring more speed then I was
used too. While climbing there was no movement from the rear suspension even
though the brain was set to open all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the brain all the way was Jurriaan's idea and I really liked it. The
bike felt a lot more plush and there appeared to be no negative effects to it.
What more, it was even easier to remain seated and keep pedaling even when the
ground was very uneven. The lap was over way to soon for me. I glanced at the
watch on the end of it and once again, I was 20% faster. That settles it then.
I am basically around 20% faster on this bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General ride impressions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bike is the first bike I ride at this price range and so I can't really
say how much of it is due to the Epic and how is due to it just being a class
higher then my current bike. That said, this is one mean machine. It handles
sharply, and at the same time very reassuring. It manages to absorb a lot
without disconnecting you from what is going on bellow you. It climbs faster
then my Rockhopper and leaves it in the dust on the descents. Cornering is
linear and predictable. the bike really has good grip even on loose sand. I
was, in a word, sold. In the car on the way back to Utrecht Jurriaan dropped,
"Shit, it is better then my bike".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got home, Jurriaan mailed me his improssion of the bike. For
fairness, I give the list he mailed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting position for climbing is to straight up, which leads to slow climbing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stem is angled to high up, which is not race oriented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fork is not very plush, to much race oriented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brain system is not really needed as it works great even with the brain completely open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brakes were biting to hard before adjustments. They work better after adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The XTR rear derailleur is good, the front derailleur X7 cracks but works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very stable on the descents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steers very sharp in corners, even on uneven terrain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom bracket is somewhat low, though it might be due to tilting the bike to much
As you an see, Jurriaan does not completely agree with me, but hey, its MY
test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialized, in its commercials for the Epic say its two bikes in one. It may
only have 100mm of travel but for the Netherlands thats more then enough. For
most marathons and XC it is more then enough. The Epic manages to be fast and
sharp without hurting your confidence. It climbs fast and with some
adjustments to the bar it will climb even faster. It descents really faster.
If your looking for a marathon bike I don't think you can go wrong with this
one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="epic"></category><category term="impressions"></category><category term="mtb"></category><category term="Review"></category><category term="review"></category><category term="specialized"></category></entry><entry><title>From vinyl to iTunes</title><link href="//2011/04/from-vinyl-to-itunes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-28T06:19:16+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/04/from-vinyl-to-itunes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If your like me you like you vinyl records.

Opening race of the RWP Marathon cup. Marathons are what I have
been training for and the main focus for me this season. I was really looking
forward to this one. Just 4 days before the start Sophia decided she will
participate too. This was wonderful news for me as it ment I wont have to
drive alone back after the marathon, and more importantly it will give me an
objective reference point to my improvements. You see, Sophia was with us at
the trans alp and as such, I know how I compared to her before all the
training (badly, very badly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 120km and 3000m of climbing the Kellerwald marathon is intimidating
as the first marathon of the season. It didn't help that instead of the usual
one big round, it turned out that it is a 40km circuit which you repeat, once,
twice or 3 times depending on your category. All in all it was enough to get
me worrying just how well will I be able to race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kellerwald Circuit" src="/static/images/kellerwaldround.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon we left for Gilserberg. As can be expected, things were
well arranged. There was a place for campers, and for us people with normal
cars, a school next to the starting point was converted to a sleeping area.
There was also a bar with beer. It looked like all the locals were there
drinking and laughing. The atmosphere was good, and that always helps relax.
at 22:30 we were fast asleep in our sleeping bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kellerwald Marathong race HQ" src="/static/images/Racecentral.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got up at 6 and had a good, if light breakfast. Around us it was buzzing
with activity. People doing some final test on the bikes, eating, warming up.
We were getting in the spirit of the race. The big question was what to wear.
At the moment it was around 5 degrees and cloudy. The last weather update said
19 degrees and sun. So what do you wear? I eventually decided that I will go
short all the way. Sophia went with short pants and a long sleeve shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked our number plates and headed for the start line. It was packed with
people, which was good because I was quite cold. Next to us were two elder
german riders. Even though I made it clear I don't speak german,  they tried
to make some small talk. One of them asked in very broken english if the first
round counts for the time. I couldn't imagine us going through 40km of warm up
before the timer starts so I said I am pretty sure it does. The germans
however looked unconvinced. Then the countdown from 10 started and we were
off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody started at an easy pace, which was kind of odd for me, especially
after the Bergrace start tempo. After a few hundred meters tarmac we got off
to a gravel path and started circling back towards the start. It then hit me
what these germans meant with first round. Its this double back loop. It
definitely helps to get a more ordered start once you pass by a second time.
Since this is my first Kellerwald marathon I don't know if they do this every
time or not. This does seem to be the norm though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia and me were cycling together at first. I was expecting her to just fire
by me. To my surprise I was holding back to stay with her. She is however a
much better athlete, and so I figured warming up with her is probably better
then some mad starting dash, so we continued together. After around 6 km we
hitted the first big climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path was a wide forest path typical to germany. As I expected, 10 minutes
into the climb Sophia started to edge away from me. I was already way above
the heart rate I was planning on going and so I let her go. Another 5 minutes
and she was 300m or so ahead of me. She wasn't, however, going any further.
This was ver uplifting for me. More uplifting was that I was passing people on
the way up. A totally new experience for me. Then the climb was over and it
was time hammer it down. "I am going to catch up to Sophia" was all I was
thinking. The path changed to a wonderful, slippery, and tight singletrack.
Even though I was one of the few people riding a hardtail bike, I was passing
people left and right. Then I erred and went to wide on a corner. Breaking
like mad I just barely escaped crashing into a tree. The train of people I
passed all went by before I could continue. Slightly dishearten but still
feeling good, I went at it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I was hammering it and passing people. What I didn't count on was
that this is the big league. I got passed as well a few times by guys going so
fast you would think they are on DH bikes and not XC. This too, was a new
experience for me. The singletrack decent ended and I saw sophia not 20 meters
ahead of me. Then we reached the second big climb and it started with a very
steep, slippery grass field. I tried to shift down on my front derailleur but
it just wouldn't go. So I  stopped and did it manually. Sophia was by now once
again 200 meters ahead. That field was a real killer, but I made it. As we
continued climbing I was, ever so slowly coming closer and closer to Sophia.
The second really hard part of the climb was a rocky steep slope that are so
common in the Ardenen in Belgium. Some people were already walking as I cycled
past them. Then the climb got less intensive and I was able to pick up the
tempo. By this time I was quite close to Sophia. "Thats it" I decided and
increased my tempo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took me around 30 seconds, and I was out of breath, but I caught her.  We
cycled together for around a minute or two. The tempo was to slow for my
comfort. Not what I expected. So I told Sophia good luck and I went ahead.
When the decent came it was again a brilliant twisted single track. Wonderful
choice the organization made. Somewhere there was the first support/food stop.
I just zoomed by. I was commited to this and I was only planning on stopping
if I really had to. I remebered there were 3 big climbs with the middle one
being the real bastard of them. The last one was the smallest of the three so
I was really surprised when I saw ust how steep this third, smaller climb was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it was a wide path a car could drive on, some people were walking.
It was just that steep. Then a corner and just like that it was over and I was
in open fields heading back to Gilserberg. It took me 2:20 to finish the first
round. Not as fast as I hopped. Even though my pace was not as planned, I
decided to take it down a notch. With two rounds to go, this was no time to go
crazy and to finish my body before time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second round felt a lot harder. My legs started to hurt, the climbs felt
steeper and even on the down hill parts I was going slower because of muscle
fatigue. This time I stopped at the supply point and had a bite. I was fully
expecting Sophia to come flying by. She didn't. With most of the race behind
me I left, feeling physically tired but mentally strong. I got back to the
start point, and there was no way to continue, only a path to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 0713" src="/static/images/IMG_0713.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the hell?!" I stopped and ask some spectators and they said it was
finished. "Oh fuck, oh fuck" Was all I could think of. I passed the finish
line at 5 hours 11 minutes after doing only 80km and 2000 climbing meters. I
asked one of the organizers and he said that indeed they closed the path to
continue because otherwise it would have taken to long for people to finish.
When I asked how long ago he said something like 10-15 minutes ago. I was
mentally broken. 15 min to late! My first DNF! I was furious and devastated
all at once. Apparently, so they told me, its on the website, which btw, is
all in german. With a broken heart I set my trusty Specialized Rockhopper
aside and stood at the finish to wait for Sophia. She arrived about a quarter
of an hour after me. She physically broken and have, apparently already
decided to stop even before she saw she had to. Somewhere on the 50km line she
just went empty. I still think she is fitter then me, but finishing ahead of
her was for a moral boost because I finally had some way to measure my
progress, which was, it seems, quite big. We took a shower had a nice steak
from the BBQ with a good, cold, much deserved, beer and drove home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great learning experience for me. Even though I ended DNF,
I learned a lot about racing in general(Totally new to it), marathons(long),
and racing in germany(time limit). Since this is my first season racing, I am
trying, as much as possible, to look at it as a learning season, and to be
less focused on results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map shows my progress. For more details you can look at the page on
runkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I found a video of the marathon filmed by one of the participants that gives a good idea of the track.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="kellerwald"></category><category term="marathon"></category><category term="Marathon"></category><category term="mtb"></category><category term="race"></category><category term="Race"></category><category term="rwp"></category></entry><entry><title>Branch'em and Tag'em</title><link href="//2011/04/branchem-and-tagem.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-13T13:47:50+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/04/branchem-and-tagem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Version control is one of those essential programming tools that, when first
coming across its not immediately clear how beneficial it is, but after using
it for a while you just don't understand how you could have lived without it.
Aside from the obvious benefits it gives you for actual versioning of your
code, it makes controlling what code is on the live site is running on quite
easy. In this guide I will explain how we usually go about using version
control software to control the live code. At the moment we are (still) using
svn at Dutch Open Projects and so this guide is showing svn code. The same
principles can be applied if you are using mercurial or git, but the commands
will be different (Mercurial en git actually have a proper tagging system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide I assume that the repository has the following construction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this guide is about controlling code on the live server an assumption is
made that the trunk head is what you want to set on the live server. Also
there are two servers here &lt;code&gt;devel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;live&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three commands that are used in this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are totally unfamiliar with these commands, I recommend you read about
them first as it will help clear up what is actually happening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updating Release Branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that needs to be done is to retrieve which reversion the
release branch is in. The following command will show you that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn log svn://devel/path/to/repository/branches/release -v | less&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output generated by svn is piped to the less command for easier reading.
In this manner you can retrieve the last revision in this branch. Now that the
start point is known a merge van be executed. assumeing the last revision in
the releasse banch is 1234 the merge command will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;svn merge -r:1234:HEAD svn://devel/path/to/repo/trunk
svn://devel/path/to/repo/branches/release&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

leather to seven when the alarm clock goes off. I am however not in need of
it's alarm. I am already wide awake. Today, Sunday the 27 of march 2011, is my
first race. Ever. I spent Saturday evening with Bas preparing my bike for the
race. We tuned the gears, oiled everything and after some thought decide on a
different tire setup. Nic for the front and Ralph for the rear. It's all dry
so this should be faster. I made sure I got to bed in time so I would get
enough sleep. That didn't quite go as plan. I was wide awake by the time the
alarm went off. I have no idea how long I have been lying in bed fully awake
and trying to relax. The ring of my alarm clock was the sound of freedom. It
was time to get started. My gear was already packed so I grabbed a healthy
breakfast loaded the car and was on my way. Even though I did my best to stay
calm it was hard not to feel excited. At times it was positive expectation, at
time a lot of fear for all sorts of horrible failure. Arriving in Wageningen I
took my time getting my number board (35) changing clothes and hanging the
board on my bike. In my attempt to stay calm and take it easy, I took so much
time that I no longer had time for a warmup lap. Here is thus my first lesson.
Taking your time is fine, but keeping an eye on the clock is just as
important. Because I was one of the first to register for the race I was in
the group that stone at the front. I knew I was not going to play with the
insane start sprint so my start position was good, but for me not ideal. I was
considering what to do to get out of the way as fast as I can when we were
told one minute to start. [caption id="attachment_16" align="alignnone"
width="512" caption="The start lineup at the front, with me right in the
middle"]&lt;img alt="" src="/static/images/IMG_38591.jpg" /&gt;[/caption] 30 seconds, 15 seconds, And
off we were. It was indeed crazy, people zipping by left and right, shoving
their bikes in front of me. I couldn't resist and started sprinting as well,
after about 100m I was able to reason with myself and calm down. Then I
sprinted again, then slowed, and back to sprint. It went like this for about 5
min. I was no longer being passed constantly and could calm myself into a
normal tempo. [caption id="attachment_17" align="alignnone" width="384"
caption="Geting into my own tempo"]&lt;img alt="" src="/static/images/P32788571.jpg" /&gt;[/caption] Getting my head straight I
focused on the trail. There was sand, lots of sand, at every corner. Good for
practice but a kill for my flow. Then all of a sudden I was finished with the
first round. I glance at my watch, and see I did it in just over 14 minutes.
Damn that's fast I think to myself. Average was suppose to be 18 minutes.
Little did I know the first round is somewhat shorter. [caption
id="attachment_18" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="Climbing
up"]&lt;img alt="" src="/static/images/P3279031.jpg" /&gt;[/caption] The round was quite nice. As
expected there was very little in the way of climbing, with only one short
steep climb. That is not to say that the track was flat. The track had a nice
ascent and descent flow to it which was  very entertaining. Despite all the
sand the the corners, i was getting more and more into a flow. Round two took
me 20 minutes. After an hour I was taken in by the leading group. I was
working as hard a I dared considering the time I still needed to cycle but I
was slowly realizing it was not fast enough. Tried as i did i couldn't really
accelerate. Whenever i tried to cycles somewhat faster i was getting really
tired really quick. Looking back at my round times it took me about an hour to
warm up and get comfy on the bike. Once there my time started to drop again.
[caption id="attachment_19" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="Sand and
big logs made for some tricky cornering"]&lt;img alt="" src="/static/images/P3279133.jpg" /&gt;[/caption] Unfortunately it wasn't
enough. Just before the second hour I was taken once more by the leading
group. This led to me being able to ride only 7 rounds placing me far in the
back of the field. Crosing the finish line, my legs were feeling tired but my
back was killing me. Might be time to switch to a fully. I ended up 204 from
245 overall and 42 from 44 in the masters +30. Considering this is my first
race I guess finishing better then a fifth of the participants is quite good.
Still I was hoping for more. Looking back at the result I was able to score
much better if I was about a minute and a half faster each round. One thing is
clear though. I need to get faster, fast. I stayed around for the 75 minutes
race to cheer on Bas, Tim and Bob. Bas registered somewhat late and therefore
started way in the back. He did his best to catch up with Tim and Bob. Bob
however had other plans. He got a flat tire after 35 min and was out. Tim with
a great finish managed to stay just ahead of Bas. While cheering my mates
there was a big crash right in front of me. Two rides, and flying bicycles.
Sometimes things can get ugly. [caption id="attachment_21" align="alignnone"
width="456" caption="Me and some other spectators, helping crashed
riders"]&lt;img alt="" src="/static/images/IMG_4920.jpg" /&gt;[/caption] Using the bike to get to work
is a great way for me to train. However just cycling there is definitely not
enough. I need to add intervals to that ride as to improve my speed. My next
race is the Kellerwald marathon, the first RWP Cup race and I plan on
delivering a better result. I have three weeks to improve my speed. Here's
hoping I manage to. &amp;amp;nbsp_place_holder;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bergrace"></category><category term="mtb"></category><category term="race"></category><category term="Race"></category><category term="wageningen"></category><category term="xc"></category><category term="XC"></category></entry><entry><title>Obertauern</title><link href="//2011/03/obertauern.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-03-12T16:27:42+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2011/03/obertauern.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Obertauern, the powder bowl of Austria! Boy oh boy was I looking forward to
our week there. For two years now I was planning on going there. Always had to
cancel because it was just to expensive. Not this year though. This year we
were going. I usually go with Erwin and Marcelo, both of which are way, way,
better than I am. This time I was going with my wife and friends of ours and
so I found myself in a new position. That of the top dog. And so we went, the
four of us to what should have been Powder valhalla. Except it wasn't. The
2010/11 season sure has been a weird one. When I came to Austria at October
there was meters of powder all over the place. At March, when we arrived at
Obertauern, there was no powder and very little snow. In fact it has not
snowed in almost 3 weeks. Riding powder was just not going to happen. The
pistes were in good shape. It is weird talking about Obertauern in terms of
pistes but hey, its all I had. Being the top dog did give me a lot of
confidence and I noticed I was pushing harder and going faster then I am with
Marcelo and Erwin. Just goes to show how important self confidence is. Then
again it can also be a hazard. On the fourth day I made a jump but mistimed my
pop and so ended up landing on my nose. That gave me a big pop I didn't quite
expect. "Oh shit" was al I could think as i landed on my left shoulder. Hard.
My shoulder has suffered its share of snowboard crashes but this has been one
of the worse. Took me two days to recover. One thing I tried for the first
time now was filming while riding. Since I don't have a helm cam, I held my

&lt;p&gt;The 13 of february I rode for the first time in months a proper tour. With the
racing season coming closer by, it was a good chance to see how much all the
winter training had helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the not dutch among you, Brabant is one of the provinces in the
Netherlands. This being the Netherlands means that the highest point is 60m.
Its more of a hill then anything else, although for dutch XC tracks, its
pretty high. The tour had a good mixture of technical single track and simple,
recovery flats. There were some minor climbs and descents, but aside from the
roof, nothing really big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the spinning I did through the winter I was expecting to be very
fast. I wasn't. It took me just over 3 hours to finish the 50 km tour. That is
slower than I ever was. At first this really got me down. It seed that all the
training has only made me slower. After getting home and thinking more about
it I tend to think that I was so slow more thanks to the fact that it was 90%
mud more then that training has made me slow. It was also a good wake up call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yours truely at the tour" src="/static/images/IMG_5132.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowingly it seems I was expecting after just 8 months of training to be
as fast as the leading group. Somehow, in my subconscious, I got myself
convinced I was already prime spot material. Quite unrealistic of me, and its
good that it surfaced now and not at an actually competition. I need, it
seems, a reminder of what my realistic expectations are for this season,
otherwise I risk getting overtrained.&lt;/p&gt;

When I donated to it at
kickstarter, the project was not yet fully financed. It eventually turned to
be the most successful project kickstarter has managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The box" src="/static/images/img_0567.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I donated $70 I got the LunaTik and the TikTok. Inside were two boxes for
the two arm bands. The iPod nano I ordered a week ago and was ready for
insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Arm band and iPod" src="/static/images/IMG_0569.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LunaTik was what I was after, but I did take the time first to see how the
TikTok looked like. I think it looks really good with the red nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TikTok" src="/static/images/img_0572.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to build the LunaTik. I laid all the parts in ready&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 0574" src="/static/images/IMG_0574.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together was quite easy and took about two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG 0575" src="/static/images/IMG_0575.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is at full glory. I absolutely adore it. The design is brilliant,
the material feels good and overall it feels like a quality product.
Definitely a thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;

A friend of mine has always dreamed
about crossing the alps on a mountain bike. This guy was definitely not new to
mountain bike adventures. He has already cycled, over a period of three months
along the rockies from Canada to Mexico. One evening in February 2010 we
decided that this is going to be the year to do it. In the few months to
follow we gathered a group of friends together and in July we left for
Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain biking has been a hobby of mine for a few year then, though I cannot
really say that I have been serious about it. In the three years preceding the
trip, I had about 6 mountain bike weekends in the Ardennen and an occasional
ride in the Netherlands. Actually, I was way more interested in snowboarding
and longboarding at the time. Also I was not very fit, while the rest of the
group where all very fit people. All this led me to expect, upon returning,
that I would probably want to throw away my mountain bike, or at least not see
them for a long long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, I was dangling behind the group a lot, but as the week
progressed, that distance became smaller and smaller (My stamina was improving
while everybody else's was decreasing). More interesting was that with each
day I was enjoying myself more and more. At the end of the week, I wish it
would not end, I want more. A lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to the Netherlands, instead of storring away my bike, I just
wanted to ride them. All the time. So I decided to try a marathon race.
Together with Erwin, who also got the mountain bike bug during our transalp
adventure, we signed up for the Houffamarathon. The Houffamarathon in
Houffalize, Belgium is one of the hardest in europe. Since I have mountain
biked there before I knew the area was great for riding. Erwin opted for the
117km, I went with the 77km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cold and rainy, the course was full of mud, and it was an absolute
blast. For some weird reason, I found out that though my body was in pain I
was having the time of my life. It is then that the words of Dean Karnazes
came back to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Somewhere along the line, we mistook comfort for happiness"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was definitely not comfortable, but I was very very happy. After the fun I
had at the Houffamarathon, I participated in two more before the season ended.
The dutch mountain bike marathon championship at Groesbeek (Hel van Groesbeek)
and the Bart Brentjens challenge. Again, each race was an enjoyment. It was
hard, and I was in pain quite a lot, but as a whole I was feeling very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not just races though. After returning from the transalp, I started
cycling to work (A 22km ride) almost every day, and riding trails as much as I
can. Some weeks I was exceeding the 200km. I was feeling happier, and as
another nice side effect I was loosing excessive fat. It is next to impossible
not to be motivated when all this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter is now at full force here in the Netherlands with temperatures under
freezing most of the time and a lot of snow, so even though I do try and ride
trails I have not been able to do a lot of it as of late. The good news is
that spring is coming closer inch by inch, and this time I will be ready. I
have applied for a racing license and this season I intend to compete in as
many races as I can physically and mentally manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes that I have gone through this last 6 months have been way more
then simply a newfound passion for the sport. I am more confident, my focus
has improved and all in all I am happier.  Loosing a few Kgs extra weight has
also been very appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be to far of to say that I have, in a sense, reinvented my life. My
priorities have shifted, I live more fully and I am fitter an healthier.  My
intention here is to keep myself motivated but also to try and help other
people started in this wonderful sport.&lt;/p&gt;

web technology. The server will be nginx, combined with nodejs. For the
database side there are two options to consider: MongoDB and CouchDB. Since I
know two little about these two databases, I decided to try them both out and
see which one comes on top, for my needs. As this is the first time I will be
using any of these databases, the first step is of course installation, which
I will need to go through twice, once for the development environment and once
for the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB - Download unzip and put where you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CouchDB - Has been building for over 5 min, and had to rerun make once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am installing on OS X 10.6.4 running on a Macbook. No ports, just bash. As
you can see, MongoDB is in much easier to install. Next up is configuring to
work with node.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: It took me almost an hour to finish installing CouchDB. To be fair most
of it was from dependencies that were needed and for installing Erlang. Then
again, I dont know many machines that come with Erlang out of the box, so you
will probably need to go through this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

of combining it later on with our ticketing system. Getting it going on my
MacBook proved to be more challenging then expected. Most of the problems were
easily solvable, but finding the oplossing proved to be tricky. Therefor I
have decided to create this simple guide, showing the steps I have taken to
get everything going. &lt;strong&gt;Step 1: PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt; You can download a binary
installer from the &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/"&gt;PostgreSQL site&lt;/a&gt;. It
will install Postgre to your &lt;code&gt;/Library&lt;/code&gt; folder. This should take care of the
Postgre part. &lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Sql-Ledger&lt;/strong&gt; Ledger is written in perl, and requires
perl to run. Luckily Snow Leopard comes standard with perl. What it does not
come standard with is the perl binding for PostgreSQL. The following 3
commands will take care of that: &lt;code&gt;sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install +YAML"&lt;/code&gt; YAML is
not necessary but it can be helpful, and lacking YAML might give you problems
with DBI. &lt;code&gt;sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install DBI"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install
DBD::Pg"&lt;/code&gt; This will install the perl binding for PostreSQL. Download Sql-
Ledger from &lt;a href="http://www.sql-ledger.com/source/sql-ledger-2.8.31.tar.gz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
As of this writing, the latest version is 2.8.31 Unzip and untar the archive
and follow the instructions in the readme file. I did not manage to build
using the automated script and had to do everything by hand. There is also
&lt;a href="http://www.sql-ledger.org/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=source/mac/howto-
sql-ledger-osx.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on the ledger page with a somewhat oldish instructions
for OS X. Once Ledger is tested and it is working, its time to get the python
binding &lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Python binding&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The pyhton binding is for PostgreSQL.
You can get the binding library, called Psycopg2 (don't ask me why) from
&lt;a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/download/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Download and upack it. Installing
is done by running: &lt;code&gt;python setup.py build&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;sudo python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt; If
you are not able to build it might be a problem with your path. Python is
trying to link to the PostgreSQL bin files. Try to add it to your path and
then to build again. And your done. Enjoy (or not) working with Django-Sql-
Ledger&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="django"></category><category term="guide"></category><category term="guide"></category><category term="it"></category><category term="os x"></category><category term="postgresql"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="sql-ledger"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding a movie with chapters from iMovie to iDVD</title><link href="//2010/10/adding-a-movie-with-chapters-from-imovie-to-idvd.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-10-04T22:43:32+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2010/10/adding-a-movie-with-chapters-from-imovie-to-idvd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;iLife 08 brought a big change to iMovie. iMovie 06 was a very capable video
editing software with a good plugin library. iMovie 08 has taken a step back
in the amount of pure editing feature. It seemed like apple was aiming to make
iMovie the "iPhoto for home video". One of the features not to make it to
iMovie 08 was the ability to mark chapters for iDVD. In iLife 08 when you
import a movie from iMovie to iDVD you get it as one movie. There is no way to
break it down to chapters in iDVD as well. In comes GarageBand. Made not only
for music but also for creating podcasts, GarageBand can put markers on a
track. iDVD will see these marks as well and treat them as chapters.  To mark
chapters in a movie follow the following steps: 1. Start a new project in
GarageBand and remove the default audio track. 2. in the media browser, select
your iMovie movie that you want to add chapters to and drag it to GarageBand
track window. 3. By pressing P, or choosing ---- you can add a chapter marker
at the player head location. I suggest you give the chapters more meaningful
names then the default "Chapter" plus number that is automatically generated.
Once you have all the chapters marked there are two options to get this into
iDVD. If this movie is the only movie you want to have chaptered in your DVD,
you choose the export to iDVD option. If you choose this option a menu with
the option to play the whole movie, or to choose between chapters will be
created as well as chapter selection sub-menus. Although this option is the
simplest, you wont be able to combine two or more chaptered movies like this.
To get around this you need to add one more step before going into iDVD. In
GarageBand choose the "export to iTunes" option. This will add the movie to
the the iTunes movie library. Going now to iDVD, create a new project or open
one you already have made. In the media browser go to iTunes section in the
movie tab and drag the movie to the menu you want it on. iDVD will create the
menus like it would if you would export from GarageBand. By creating a new
menu page you can add another film. In this way you can have more then one
chaptered  movie in iDVD.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="guide"></category><category term="guide"></category><category term="idvd"></category><category term="ilife"></category><category term="imovie"></category><category term="mac"></category><category term="os x"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up Solr for Drupal under tomcat</title><link href="//2010/07/setting-up-solr-for-drupal-under-tomcat.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-07-13T08:37:56+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2010/07/setting-up-solr-for-drupal-under-tomcat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This method will probably not work for all servers running tomcat,
it is more a personal guide then a general one. Solr is a "popular, blazing
fast open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project".
Drupal search has traditionally been less then adequate. Using Solr to index
and search you Drupal site is therefore quite helpful. To start, download the
Solr package (&lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and
the Solr drupal module (&lt;a href="http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). the
current standard distribution is Solr 1.4 and Drupal 6. Unarchive the tar
files in a location that is reachable from your server. We will assume that
tomcat is installed in &lt;code&gt;/opt/tomcat&lt;/code&gt; In the Solr package there is an example
application. That is the Solr application we are going to use. If you can
write your own, you probably don't need this tutorial. &lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Copy the
example application, found in the solr package under &lt;code&gt;example/webapps&lt;/code&gt; to the
tomecat webapps folder which should be &lt;code&gt;/opt/tomcat/webapps&lt;/code&gt;. when copying the
file rename it to something other the solr. this will enable you to have
multiplie solr installations running under one Tomcat container. We will
assume the app is renamed &lt;code&gt;new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt;. If you are in the tomcat root
folder the command should like like this: &lt;code&gt;cp /path/to/solr/package/apache-
solr-1.4.0/apache-solr-1.4.0/example/webapps/solr.war
webapps/new_solr_inst.war&lt;/code&gt; Tomcat will pick up the war file and open it
automatically after a restart. &lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; In the tomcat root folder create a
folder to hold your Solr configuration and data. &lt;code&gt;mkdir new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt; Copy
the example app configuration into that folder &lt;code&gt;cp -R /path/to/solr/package
/apache-solr-1.4.0/apache-solr-1.4.0/example/solr/* new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt;
You need to replace the original &lt;code&gt;schema.xml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;solrconfig.xml&lt;/code&gt; with the
ones provided by the drupal module. Copy these two files to your Solr
configuration folder. Assuming you are currently at the tomcat root folder &lt;code&gt;cp
/path/to/solr/module/schema.xml new_solr_inst/conf&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;cp
/path/to/solr/module/solrconfig.xml new_solr_inst/conf&lt;/code&gt; The Solr app is now
ready for use. &lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The last step is needed to inform Tomcat about the
app and its settings. Go to &lt;code&gt;conf/Catalina/localhost&lt;/code&gt; and create the file
&lt;code&gt;new_solr_inst.xml&lt;/code&gt;. In that file fill the following content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Context docBase="/opt/tomcat/webapps/new_solr_inst.war" debug="0"
privileged="true" allowLinking="true" crossContext="true"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Environment name="solr/home" type="java.lang.String"
value="/opt/tomcat/new_solr_inst" override="true" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/Context&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to restart tomcat &lt;code&gt;/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh&lt;/code&gt; And your Solr should be running. There are three tests we can use to check everything went well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomcat has opened the war file. There is now a folder &lt;code&gt;new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;webapps&lt;/code&gt; folder of Tomcat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solr has made a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory in the Solr home folder (that is &lt;code&gt;/opt/tomcat/new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your browser go to the Solr app &lt;code&gt;http://domain:tomcat_port/new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt; and you should see a welcome screen
If all is well you are ready to combine this Solr installation with your
Drupal &lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Activate the Apache-Solr module and go to the Solr module
settings page &lt;code&gt;admin/settings/apachesolr&lt;/code&gt; Assuming tomcat and drupal are
running on the same server fill in &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; as the host name, fill in the
port tomcat is running on and solr path should be your app name in the tomcat
webapps folder. In our case is it &lt;code&gt;new_solr_inst&lt;/code&gt;. Save the settings. Drupal
should inform you that a connection is made with Solr Notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not nessecary to put the app configuration in the Tomcat root folder. you can probably (though I have not tested this) place it anywhere you want. you do need to make sure that the environment tag in the Tomact configuration file (the one in the &lt;code&gt;conf/Catalina/localhost&lt;/code&gt; folder) is pointing to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make changes to the schema you may need to dump all the indices Solr has made. you can do this via the Drupal admin interface for the Solr module.&lt;/li&gt;

One can always query they
table to get the session ID. There is however a faster way. If the user is
logged it, the session id can be found with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case the session id can also be read from the cookie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$&lt;span class="n"&gt;_COOKIE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()];&lt;/span&gt;

One of the nicest tricks is the
ability to theme the form in stages. Calling drupal_render on a part of the
form will not only return the rendered version of it, but it will also mark
that part as rendered so that when you call the final drupal_render over the
whole form, it will not re-render the parts already rendered. Remember that in
order for the form to function correctly there are some hidden fields in every
form that must be added to the form. Also drupal needs to generate the form
tag. Therefore it is my advise, after doing the custom rendering of the parts
you want, add a general render of the form. this will reduce the chance of
problems with form submission. Special thanks to Rolf van de Krol, for this
tip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drupal"></category><category term="form api"></category><category term="Me"></category><category term="php"></category><category term="theming"></category></entry><entry><title>Views 2 integration and custom handlers in Drupal 6</title><link href="//2010/02/views-2-integration-and-custom-handlers-in-drupal-6.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-10T19:32:46+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2010/02/views-2-integration-and-custom-handlers-in-drupal-6.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of a large scale project at work, I needed to create an integration
between views and a module I was writing. For it to function properly, a
custom handler was also needed. Unfortunately there was very little
information to be found about how this must be done. The integration process
is not that complex, and it can be understood from the code sample given in
the views 2 docs. A custom handler however proved to be somewhat more elusive.
To do my part in helping clear some of it up, I will give a simplified, step
by step, guide how I have solved this. I am by no means an expert when it
comes to views, and it is possible that there are better solutions out there.
I, however, was unable to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simplified version of the actual module we will imagine a module that is
intended to collect messages generated by users actions. The module will then
show actions generated by your "friends". Think something like Facebooks news
feed. How you befriend someone or how the messages are generated are not
important for this guide, so just assume that it all goes well. When it does
pay a roll, I will give all the needed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our module is called buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages have a few pre-set forms (think facebook's news feed again) with
a few values that change. For instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;username has added a photo to his profile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the amount of data in the database we will define table that
contains the text of he message, and which arguments are expected. In this
way, the actual message just needs to save the message type and the arguments,
preventing repeating the whole message. It also gives more flexibility in
changing the form of the message to all messages at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following schema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/01/buzz-db-schema.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Schema describing the database" src="/static/images/buzz-db-schema-" title="300x213.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;represent how the data is being saved into the database. The database tables
are built using hook_schema() and hook_install(). The messages are entered
into the database via an API that the module offers. The specifics are not
important for this post, though if there will be demand for it I will post
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Views Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few advantages to integrate your module's data module with
views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility in representation of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier for other people to work with your module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name two major ones. Views integration is done through the use of the
hook_views_data(). What this hook does basically is tell views all that it
needs to know in order to be able to work with your data model. I'll give the
implementation first, followed by an explaintion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;buzz_views_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;buzz_message_types&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;group&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Buzz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;join&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lets look at what everything does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing is defining an array. This array, called &lt;code&gt;$data&lt;/code&gt;, will contain the
information describing to views how the data of our module is built. Each
table in out database will be represented by a separate entry in the the array
with the key being the database table name. In our case the module has two
tables, buzz_message_type and buzz_messages, and therefore the array has two
entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each database table entry is in itself an array. In this array we give views
general information about the table as well information about each column.
Before we continue lets me explain what a base table in views is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a new view, you get to choose what will be used as a base table
for that view. That is, views will start with that table as its beginning
values and will expand from there as needed (through the use of
relationships). Those tables (such as node, users) are defined for views as
base tables. If you are interested in building views that are based upon your
modules information, it can be helpful to define one of your modules table as
a base table. Note that you can integrate your information with views without
defining a base table (we will see that soon). In our case, since we are
interested in creating views that represent only messages we will define the
messages table as a base table.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drupal"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="views2"></category><category term="web"></category><category term="web"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Sir Richard Francis Burton</title><link href="//2009/08/sir-richard-francis-burton.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-08-31T10:52:42+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2009/08/sir-richard-francis-burton.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/758.html"&gt;Sir Richard Francis Burton&lt;/a&gt;:

It was
horrible. Burned my mouth completely. I was, as can be expected young and knew
nothing about whiskey, aside form the name. And that it was apparently "cool"
to drink. So I tried. After that one sip I stayed of whiskey for over two
years. The second tim eI tasted whiskey, it was a Johnnie Walker Black label.
It was strong, burning, and delightful. I do not know what has changed in
those two years or if something changed at all. Maybe if I had tried the black
first instead of the red, I would be set right off the start. For the next
three years or so I only drank Johnnie Blacks. As my taste evolved I stated
trying more whiskeys. Like most people I started to value the single malts
more and more. Eventually completely abandoning the blended sorts, of which
Johnnie was my darling. Nowadays I have at home a small collection of singles,
out of which I drink a glass almost daily. Whiskey has definitely become my
favorite strong drink. Johnnie had a lot to do with it That is why I was so
delighted to see this 6 minute film over the history of Johnnie Walker. Even
if you are not a fan of the drink, or the brand, it is worth 6 minutes of your
time&lt;/p&gt;

using Google Reader as my rss reader. Managing feeds was simple, though not
ideal and it was accessible from just about any computer. Better yet, I did
not need to find way to sync between all my different rss readers, which was
starting to get tiresome. On the iPhone the situation was a bit different.
Even though Google Reader on the iPhone is reasonable, it felt slugish and not
very natural. Running in mobile safari, that was of course, to be expected. I
decided it was time to look for a dedicated rss reader for the iPhone. I was
looking for an application that offered syncing with Google Reader, and that
was about it.  I decided to try Byline from Phantom Fish. I have been using
Byline for a month now and am very happy with it. So much so I decided to
write my first app review about it. Let me give you a closer look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The icon:&lt;/strong&gt; Clear and unique enough to not be confused with other apps. The icon is definitely beautiful, though in my opinion it could have been a bit more abstract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up:&lt;/strong&gt; Setting up is as simple as logging into your google account. Works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage:&lt;/strong&gt; The app is responsive and slick. It feels fast and the UI is very natural. I cant imagine going back to Google Reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sync:&lt;/strong&gt; Syncing works really well. I can't remember having any kind of trouble with it.
As I mentioned before, Byline also caches the feeds so that you can read while
offline. Traveling around europe regularly, it is possible for me to use my
rss reader without the need to pay ridiculous amounts of money for roaming
data (1 voor 100kb).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I am very happy with Byline. It does everything I wanted it to do,
and it does it well. What I am missing is the ability to view entries per feed
instead of per group. However this is a minor complain seeing the overall
experience. In fact I liked the use of Byline so much, I switched back to an
rss reader app on my computers as well. Readers that sync with Google Reader
that is. Look at &lt;a href="http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html"&gt;Phantom Fishs&lt;/a&gt;

executing an innocent man is not unlawful because he was found guilty in a
legal trial. New findings which can acquit said innocent man, are, for justice
Scalia, no reason not not proceed with what a court has found to be just. That
may sound strange, even scary coming from a supreme court justice. The thing
is, I have seen this kind of thinking before from people who give service to
society. Sometimes they seem to loose sight of what is actually the grand
reason for them being there. They stop seeing their system as a system that
gives service to society, but that society is there so obey their wonderful
system. This I believe is exactly what happened to justice Scalia. He lost
sight of the reason he is there. To serve society. Executing an innocent man
does not do that in any way. Look at it from the other direction, and you can
see how he reasons. One must ask himself if someone who completely lost sight
of what its all about could, or should, remain in his position. For more

In a
production site that is exactly what you what. However when developing, cache
can cause you much pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your an expert in drupal you probably already realized when you need to
clear the cache in order to see changes and when not too. the developer module
even makes it quite easy to do. However for me, and I am quite sure to quite a
lot of other people it is not that clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait", you might say. "Drupal has a disable cache setting". You would be
right to say that. Only it doesn't completely disable the cache, only part of
the cache, namely the page caching. To truly disable cache you need to do a
bit of a hacking to the cache code. Yes I know they say to never hack core
(cache is part of the core drupal release). for me this was worth it. I figure
as long as you remember its there and don't use it in production you should be
fine. The following piece of code needs to be added in &lt;code&gt;include/cache.inc&lt;/code&gt;.
There are two functions there that you need to edit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cache_get&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cache_set&lt;/code&gt;
In &lt;code&gt;cache_get&lt;/code&gt; place the code right after the &lt;code&gt;global $user&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;cache_set&lt;/code&gt;
place it at the start of the function. Here is the code that you need to add.
&lt;code&gt;if(variable_get('cache', CACHE_DISABLED) == CACHE_DISABLED) { return 0; }&lt;/code&gt;
Kudos for this hack goes to Rolf van de Krol. Cheers mate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20/5 I took my camera with me to work to make some pictures of the vila
and its surrounding. This gate is the starting point of the path I jog on
regularly. The sun was just coming up, it was all really wonderful to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The start of a path in the woods next to the DOP

&lt;p&gt;The next picture is for the 21/5. That was a Thursday and Eran arrived for a
visit. Made a mas out of Aharale and Mine plans to go climbing in France.
Totally worth it though. Its great seeing Eran, which I have not seen for a
very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eran sitting in Oliver's garden" src="/static/images/img_0038.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture for the 22 is not dramatic. Unfortunately I have had little time
to actually take pictures that day, so I stuck the camera outside the living
room picture and snapped a few shots. &lt;img alt="Plantsoen park from out apartment

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the 23, Paula returned from her hiking vacation in the lake
district. While I was waiting for her ship to dock up, I came across this
sign. I just had to take a picture of it. Quite brilliant if you ask me.

While these are still used for
web development they are defenetly on the way out. For this reason I have
decided to set up a more up to date MAMP installation on my old Powerbook G4.
While this was all done on Tiger, it will most likely also work on Leopard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation process follows mostly the unix standard. That means that you
will want to have the a /usr/local folder made. If you do not have it yet,
type the following in terminal: &lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /usr/local&lt;/code&gt; The advantage of
using local is that whenever a system updates itself it leaves local alone. If
you install directly into /usr/bin, there is a chance that a system update
will overwrite your installed software with its own update. If you lost me by
now, you are probably off downloading a MAMP binary now. The first step is to
retrieve the packages we will need to properly install MAMP. To keep it nice
and organized make a folder that will contain the source code, if you do not
yet have a designated folder. &lt;code&gt;mkdir ~/src&lt;/code&gt; We can now start installing MAMP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;MySQL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that will be installed is MySQL. You can get the latest dmg
&lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#macosx-dmg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After
installing MySQL from the dmg, I also recommend installing
&lt;a href="http://www.sequelpro.com"&gt;Sequelpro&lt;/a&gt; if you want a GUI interface to the
database. For building MySQL yourself from source check
&lt;a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/view/installing-mysql-on-mac-os-x"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apache2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache comes bundled with OS X. Note that the control panel will only affect
the default installation. Starting and stopping your own Apache installation
will need some command line work, or some scripting. The following installs
Apache 2 into /usr/local/sbin/apache2, if you prefer to install into another
folder change the prefix to that folder. &lt;code&gt;curl -O
http://apache.hippo.nl/httpd/httpd-2.2.11.tar.gz tar xvzf http-2.2.11.tar.gz
cd http-2.2.11/ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/sbin/apache2 --enable-
modules=all --enable-mods-shared=all make sudo make install cd ..&lt;/code&gt; Before we
continue to build PHP there are some extra libraries that are needed. If you
are not interested in building PHP with GD you can probably skip most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Freetype&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Free, High-Quality, and Portable Font Engine. You can learn more about it
&lt;a href="http://www.freetype.org"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;curl -O
http://mirrors.zerg.biz/nongnu/freetype/freetype-2.3.9.tar.gz tar xvzf
freetype-2.3.9.tar.gz cd freetype-2.3.9/ ./configure make sudo make install cd
..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;JPEG&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for jpeg image format &lt;code&gt;curl -O
http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz tar xzf jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz cd
jpeg-6b/ cp /usr/share/libtool/config.sub . cp /usr/share/libtool/config.guess
. ./configure --enable-shared make sudo make install cd ..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Libpng&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for png image format &lt;code&gt;curl -O
ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng-1.2.36.tar.gz tar xjf
libpng-1.2.36.tar.gz cd libpng-1.2.36/ ./configure make sudo make install cd
..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;openSSL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the latest version of openSSL &lt;code&gt;curl -O
http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8k.tar.gz tar xvzf
openssl-0.9.8k.tar.gz cd openssl-0.9.8k ./config --prefix=/usr/local
--openssldir=/usr/local/ssl make sudo make install ./config shared
--prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl make clean make sudo make
install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PHP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the extra libraries are available we can continue to build PHP. We
choose to install it into &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/php5&lt;/code&gt;. As before if you wish to install
into a different location, change the prefix. &lt;code&gt;curl -O
http://de3.php.net/distributions/php-5.2.9.tar.bz2 tar xjf php-5.2.9.tar.bz2
cd php-5.2.9/ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php5 --with-
apxs2=/usr/local/sbin/apache2/bin/apxs --with-config-file-scan-
dir=/usr/local/php5/php.d --with-iconv --with-openssl=/usr/local --with-
openssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl --with-zlib=/usr --with-gd --with-zlib-dir=/usr
--with-xmlrpc --with-iconv-dir=/usr --enable-exif --enable-sqlite-utf8
--enable-ftp --enable-sockets --enable-dbase --enable-mbstring --with-bz2=/usr
--enable-fastcgi --enable-cgi --enable-zip --with-curl --with-
mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-pdo-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-libxml-
dir=shared,/usr/local/php5 --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local/php5 --with-png-
dir=/usr/local/php5 --with-freetype-dir=/usr/local/php5 make sudo make install&lt;/code&gt; You should now have a ready development system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finalization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that the newly installed software is used instead of the default
installed one make sure that &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; and the bin and php5 folders within
are in the path before &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. To start the Apache server use the
following command: &lt;code&gt;sudo /usr/local/sbin/apache2/bin/apachectl start&lt;/code&gt; Use
&lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restart&lt;/code&gt; to stop or restart the server.&lt;/p&gt;

Just being there makes me
feel slightly happier. The street names, lots of them with a meaning of their
own like Abbey road, Oxford street, Regent street, Bond street. The known
busses, the famous underground sign, the public telephone booths. London is
immediately recognizable. This visit had a wonderful bonus of having my
parents visiting it at the same time. Well that, and that the pound is
historically low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="darwin-exhibition-home_12310_1.jpg" src="/static/images/darwin-exhibition-home-12310-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2009 marks two hundred years to the birth of Darwin and a hundred and
fifty years since he published his theory of evolution. The Natural History
Museum had a special exhibition for this occasion. They did a wonderful job.
It follows the path that Darwin took, starting as a young scientist leaving
aboard the HMS Beagle on a five year trip all the way to his death. It shows
his finding, items he has used to collect and analyze them and most
importantly the whole thought pattern that went in his head. the internal
struggle with himself once he realized that the holy text version of creation
is wrong. It is sometimes hard for us to imagine but up to 150 years ago the
bible version was &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum in itself is wonderful. It covers pretty much all known life from
dinosaurs through fish and bird to mammals and humans. Since museums are now
free in England a lot of families go there. It gives the museum a living
feeling that is wonderful, especially in a museum that is about life. I highly
recommend visiting it if you get to London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other museum that I really enjoyed was the TATE modern. Located in an old
power plant building it is a fitting setting for a modern art museum. The
exhibitions varied quite a lot so there was something there for everyone. And
again, as an open museum there was a wonderful feeling of living art, instead
of observatory art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it was all culture. We spent a whole day shopping. Working our way
from Piccadilly circus through Regent street to Oxford circus and then on to
Oxford street. At the end of which we went to Soho for some good beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London was a pleasure, as it was expected as it always is. We didn't get to do
half as much as we wanted to, which means we will be coming back. As far as I
am concerned sooner is better then later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="London"></category><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Adventures in Django</title><link href="//2009/01/adventures-in-django.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-15T22:21:18+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2009/01/adventures-in-django.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a while my django project was set aside for other things. Last week I got
around to continue working on it. I have made a lot of progress and learned
quite a lot so I figured it was time for an update post. First and foremost a
beta version of the site is already online. I dont know if I wrote about what
it actually does so I'll start with that. Its a web application developed for
something me and my friends were missing. As a group we go on weekends away
quite often. Mostly climbing, mountan biking sonwoboarding or hiking. At the
end of every such weekend someone always needs to sit down and calculate
exactly how much each person payed and so caulcuate who needs to pay back who.
I figured it was time to be away with that, and I made "tripcalc" which is
ment to slove that. Everyone who payed something just fill it in and the web
app does the math and sends emails to people to let them know who they need to
pay to, or who are they getting money from. There were a lot of design
desicions I made which I am not sure if they were right or not, but that is
for another post. This one is about django, jQuery and deployment. Django has
really been a wonderful experience for me. There is rarely a day in which I
don't go "Wow that is just great, It can actually do that?!". There are a lot
of wonderful things in that framework.

I did not have a religious
upbringing, even though I was at a religious kinder garden, and I do not
believe in the existence of god. Or gods. These last six months I have been
working with, almost exclusively, quite religious people. Since I work at the
IT branch this is something that is note worthy. Most IT people I know are not
religious. Some of them believe in the existence of a god, others don't, but I
would definitely not classify them as religious. However, as I stated, I found
my self in a team in which I was pretty much the only non believer. Coming
from Israel, religion has always been something that is there. Though I am not
a believer, I always thought that there is a lot of good coming from all these
people. You could say my disposition towards religious people was positive. I
now have a strong dislike towards anyone that is considering himself
religious. and let me tell you why. In the first few weeks I was completely
fascinated by these people. My friends are not religious, neither are my
parents. You could say I grew up with little direct influence from any sort of
religion. I do realize a lot of the traditions I was raised with come from the
Jewish belief, however they were, at least for me, nothing more than that. A
tradition. And here I was surrounded by this group of true believers. We
talked about faith, about why they believe, about what they see and how they
experience the world. All 4 of them (note: 3 Christians and 1 Muslim) renounce
evolution. I got answers like "Are you a dog?" and "I do not come from an
ape". And that was about all the proof they had. That was all the proof they
needed. Well that and the holy scripts. It bothered me that I could not get
through with rational thoughts to these people. Yet at the time I did not know
quite why I was so bothered by this. I noticed I slightly shifted from being
slightly positive to getting angry with them. Here was a group of people who
are capable of thinking, that at some trail of thoughts completely lost touch
with logic. That transaction was making me frustrated and angry. why is this
happening? Why can they be perfectly logical one minute then completely break
with logic the other. They brought up their arguments, I blew them away with
pure and simple logic and so we always ended up with two things: 1. God's plan
is impossible for us to understand, or Gods way are mysterious, or things that
to us seem illogical or impossible are actually logical and possible to a God.
2. I just know it is, or, it says so in the bible. And that was that. There is
nothing to be brought against those arguments because they are just like
"because". No logic, no thinking, no reason, just "because". After a few of
these talks I started to see what was making me so upset. It was that these,
otherwise intelligent people were CHOOSING to see it like that. For the life
of me I could not understand why anyone would want to do it. Then again if I
could I would probably be a religious person. That was when the last shift was
starting to happen in my attitude towards them. I moved from getting angry at
them to feeling sorry for them. And then it finally hit me. The difference
between how they think and I think. I look at the world, and then shape my
ideas of it They have their ideas, then shape the world so that it would fit.
And that was that. These people, and this is the worst part, &lt;strong&gt;by their own
choice&lt;/strong&gt; are blind to the world. They know for sure how everything is, it is
for them just a matter of interpreting everything in a way that matches their
idea of how the world is. I now understand how people can do all the terrible
things that they do in the name of religion. They do not see it as terrible
things. I am actually convinced some of them see it as a good thing. A just
thing. My colleges think that being gay is a choice, and that its bad, because
it says so in the holy bible. I'm serious. So now all I do is feel pity for
them. They have chosen a path that was a bad idea in the middle ages, let
alone in modern time. At the same time I am growing anti-religious by the
minute. Look at the conflicts we have in the world now. Look at how many of it
is religious based. What's that you say, "Religion is just an excuses given to
the masses". Maybe, possibly. However, remove that excuses and it becomes a
lot harder to get so many people to do so many horrible things. Religion might
be misused, but if it is, than it has been for centuries. Maybe its time we
realized that the only way to stop making religion an excuse is to reduce its
power so that it can't be used as such. Think I am being to harsh, look at the
world map again, think of the conflicts that are going on now in the world.
How many are not religion related? How many are? Exactly I rest my case. Last
note. There is still hope. Every generation there are more of us thinking
people, and less of then bling people. One day, relgion will be a marginal
group. That will be a good day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="religon"></category><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Skatboarding at slow motion</title><link href="//2009/01/skatboarding-at-slow-motion.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-01-06T11:45:46+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2009/01/skatboarding-at-slow-motion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was captured at 120fps.

Last night I came
upon a problem. When testing a page outside django, the page was rendered
correctly. When it was rendered through django the javascript files were not
located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I have to admit I was a bit fullish and forgot to look at the
web server's log to see if the files were correctly served. that was an hour
and a half of trying to figure out why the javascript functions were not
found. So after smartening up I found out that the javascript files were not
found. It seemed that django kept looking for them in the wrong location.
Using the example &lt;a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-
files/?from=olddocs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I eventually got it all to working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to this. in the settings.py file there is a reference to the
media URL and to the file system path to the media directory. Adding the
following code to the urls.py &lt;code&gt;if settings.DEBUG: urlpatterns += patterns('',
(r'^tripcalc/media/(?P .*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root':
settings.MEDIA_ROOT}), )&lt;/code&gt; Will make sure that while django is in debug mode,
serving of the static files will be done via django. for production sites it
is better to let a dedicated web server (such as Apache) serve these static
files. And that took care of it. I can now continue with the development. And
it also enabled me to call the CSS file, so style is also shown. hurray.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="coding"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="web"></category><category term="web development"></category></entry><entry><title>Riding Gravity</title><link href="//2008/09/riding-gravity.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-12T12:50:27+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/09/riding-gravity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two guys, skateboards and a big hill.

I have been quite busy and so
neglected my blogging commitment. Here to make it right is a post about this
wonderful summer. During this summer I had two major vacations. Two weeks in
Berner Oberland, Switzerland, and a week in Israel out of which 3 days were
taken by a dive safari in the Red Sea. Before I start telling about these two
thought, I'd like to say that the actual travelling start with two visits to
Fontainebleau within a month. Bleau is always fun, and every time I come back
I find myself wondering why I don not go there more often. I hope this new
trend of vising at least once a month on average (more in the summer, not so
much in the winter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berner Oberland, oh, Berner Oberland. Home of the Jungfrau, the Eiger with its
world famous north face and the Aletschhorn glacier to name a few. Paula and
me spent a day in Bern, which was nice, but I was feeling restless. I wanted
to see the Eiger. So the next day we left for Launterbrunnen, which lies in a
dale starting close to Interlaken. It is a place out of a fairy tale. The dale
has walls of a few hundred meters high. A few waterfalls flow from the top to
form magnificent waterfalls. It is a place that, at least in me, steers a
feeling of magic. The next two days we spent mountain biking in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day we went up from Launterbrunnen to Muren. That proved to be a
somewhat difficult day. In total its 900m of a continuous climb. We were not
ready for that much climbing. By the time we reached Muren it really felt like
a victory. We were quite tired, and, failing to find an apple shtrudel had to
settle for a cup of coffee. The way down was fun. Those 900m went flying by.
There were a few places with warning signs instructing us to get of the bikes.
We didn't. It was fun. The next day we went for a somewhat flatter route,
going only 400m vertical. It was still bloody difficult. Our legs were tired
but the scenery was so beautiful they were easy to ignore. The third day we
were expecting Bas and Charlotte to arrive at the afternoon. Seeing as we were
about to embarke on a 8 day hike we decied to take it easy. The day's activity
consisted of getting provinces and getting the bag ready for the coming hike.
Bas said they would be there at around 16:00. So we expected them at 19:00 the
earliest. We were caught by complete surprise when Bas and Charlotte actually
arrived on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike itself was amazing. I have almost forgotten what a wonderful feeling
it is to walk in the alps, sleep in huts, and just generally be out, in
nature. Every day I was having more fun. We walked in 7 days from Grosse
Scheidek to Oeschinsee. I find my words fail me when I come to describe how it
was. The nature was so there, all around you, taking you in. Making me feel
small, and at the same time as free as can be. Standing at the foot of the
Eiger north face, looking at a wall 1700m high, its exhilarating. we were also
very lucky with the weather. We had almost exclusively sunny days. Till 16:00.
then it rained, hard. Then at 16:45 it became sunny again. Apparently it has
something to do with the area's micro climate. Lots of glaciers and a warm sun
will do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second vacation was the diving safari in Sinai. I am a new diver. Its less
then a year since I followed a diving course during our trip to Thailand. Less
then a year and already I have dives in some of the est places in the world.
Coming from Israel I am no stranger to the Red Sea. This was however the first
time I properly dived in it. The safari was a 3 day, live on-board(as in on a
boat). Every day there are 4 dives, except the last days which can only have 3
because of time constrains. I don't know if I can conclude from this first
experience about all live-onboard safaris, but I believe they are all pretty
much like this. And by this I mean totally relaxing. You have zero worries.
All you have to do. All you can do is dive, eat sleep and read. Oh and setup
discos to dance into the night, but I think that was a bit unique :) . It is
an wholly relaxing, and energy filling experience. I highly recommend it as an
anti-stress treatment. Thats it for now, I'm all written out. Ill write some
more in the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="diving"></category><category term="fun"></category><category term="Me"></category><category term="switzerland"></category><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="vacation"></category></entry><entry><title>World War Animation</title><link href="//2008/08/world-war-animation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-08-21T15:48:51+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/08/world-war-animation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The World War animation film bellow, was created by Vincent Chai for his final

services. Unfortunately, dreamhost does not officially support django. It does
not have mod_python installed. Django is instead deployed using FastCGI.
Hopefully sometime in the future mod_python will be added. There are a few
good guides I have found, that explain how to setup django on a dreamhost
account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff Croft has a good guide on his &lt;a href="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2006/may/11/django-dreamhost/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gordon Tillman also has a good informative &lt;a href="http://www.gordontillman.info/Development/DjangoDreamhost"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dreamhost wiki also has a &lt;a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Django"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;
Between the three of them you can probably find all the information needed for
installing django for use on a dreamhost account. I will not repeat what they
explain but instead add some from my own experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreamhost, at the moment of writing, is running python 2.4. Luckily it is
possible for you to locally install python. I highly recommend it as it will
enable you to setup the python environment exactly the way you want it, and it
will make it easier to upgrade to future versions of python. &lt;code&gt;cd ~/soft wget
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.2/Python-2.5.2.tgz tar xvfz
Python-2.5.2.tgz cd Python-2.5.2 ./configure --prefix ~/install/dir --enable-
shared make make install&lt;/code&gt; Where &lt;code&gt;~/install/dir&lt;/code&gt; is the directory you want
python installed in. I followed dreamhost's &lt;a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Unix_account_setup"&gt;Unix account setup
guide&lt;/a&gt; and installed it under
run. I recommend you do to, as it is easier to have full control over you
&lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;. Also adding setuptools makes future installs easier &lt;code&gt;cd ~/soft
wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
~/path/to/yourpython/python ez_setup.py&lt;/code&gt; This will add the &lt;code&gt;easy_install&lt;/code&gt;
script which will simplify adding packages to your own python install. The
final step is adding the new MySQLdb package &lt;code&gt;cd ~/soft svn co https://mysql-
python.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mysql-python/trunk/MySQLdb MySQLdb
easy_install MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt; This is assuming easy_install is in your PATH. If it is
not it needs to be added. Your now ready to install django using your very own
Python installation. That is detailed enough so I will move to two problems I
met after the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Installation Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met with two problems that had frustrated me for a few hours. To save you
the future installer some pain here they are in case you experience something
similar &lt;strong&gt;syncdb after admin activation:&lt;/strong&gt; This should have been very obvious
to me but for some reason it escaped me. After enabling the admin page you
must run &lt;code&gt;django-admin.py syncdb&lt;/code&gt; in your project home page. What happened was
that I ran it before I enabled the admin application. This lead to the
creation of the needed tables in the MySQL database, but no tables for the
admin application. After enabling the admin application, more tables need to
be created to accommodate the new application data. The errors I got gave me
the impression that there was an error in the MySQLdb egg, so I reinstalled
it, then tried to find some workaround. Eventually I realized that I'm just
missing the admin tables. &lt;strong&gt;.htacess:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the real mind bender. I kept
getting an internal server error saying that it reached maximum internal
allowed redirects. It was obviously a configuration error so I compared my
.htaccess with that of the guides and it looked the same. So I looked else,
but I kept coming back to the conclusion it has to be in the .htaccess. Yet no
matter how often I looked at it I couldn't find what was wrong. I need to
point out that I am no expret when it comes to apache and that maybe if I knew
more about it this would have been simple, but I didn't so I got some gray
hairs before I realized I'm missing a space between the - and the [L]. A
bloody white space! I was feeling furious and incredibly stupid at the same
time. Django is now up and running, and I like it so far. I sure is a lot
nicer to work with then with JSP and servlets.

interesting side effect. Unconciounsly, I find myself thinking about the
actual thinking. Am I thinking in the correct abstraction level? Are my
thought not repetition on some previous idea? Are they permutations of ideas
already mentioned? Am I making sense at all in the direction I am going at the
moment? and so forth This type of thinking, which I like to call metathinking
is quite good. Thinking is just like most other things in life, practicing it
makes you better in it. finding your weak spots and improving them makes you
even better. I could say that if I was able to isolate the process of
metathinking and do it without the need for an actual subject I would be able
to improve my thinking on a fundamental level. This unfortunately escapes me.
No matter how hard I try I cant get myself to metathink good without anything
that is giving me a direction in which to think.This leads me to believe that
I can only metathink well when I can evaluate the progress I made. The last
statement in itself is enough for a long thought, which I might o some other
time. For now lets take it at face value. Lets project it to something
physical, like jogging. Paying attention to muscle tension, breathing, and
body movement while jogging will definitely improve your jogging. So its no
wonder metathinking while being busy with something improves my analysis of
it. However research has shown the visualizing running correctly, learning to
remove muscle tension while relaxing and improving breathing while &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;
jogging also improves your jogging. Of all these exercises the visualization
seems the closest to metathinking while not thinking of anything. So why cant
I seem to be able to do it?

I am a huge fan of good UI and of
good user experience. There is no doubt in my mind that since the introduction
of javascript, and later on AJAX the general experience in using the internet
has improved. For me, watching Adobe's new &lt;a href="http://www.photoshop.com/express"&gt;Photoshop
express&lt;/a&gt; is something close to a miracle. I
remember the days that some image rollover was the coolest thing on the web.
That said there are some downsides to this. Nowadays to check your webmail,
you most likely will need quite a modern computer and a relative new browser.
The internet raised as a means to share data, and it looks to me like that
feature is being pushed a bit to the back to make room for the shiny, new,
apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said for online apps. I like the idea that my office
programs are always available, on every system with internet access. Its more
platform independent than any virtualization technology, easier sharing then
any &lt;a href="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx"&gt;mesh&lt;/a&gt; and is probably cheaper.
Then again, if all I want is to find some simple information about the address
of some business, or restaurant, there is no reason for me not to be able to
do it on a 10 year old computer running OS/2 with netscape 1. Ok I might have
gotten carried away there, but a 10 year old system with a 10 year old OS and
a 10 year old browser can probably handle basic HTML. Which means it can
display web pages. So it should be good enough. Except its not. Because every
damn site has bells and whistles. And the people who are the most to blame are
us, the users. We &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; hype, cool looking pages. Hell if I get a basic
HTML page I go away without even looking at the content. What goes through my
mind is either "This is some crap some 40 year old did in his garage after
reading the w3c tutorial" or "this cant be the right spot". So everyone got
bling bling. And we end up with browsers which are turning into an OS. I am
quite happy with X thank you. I don't need to run Safari OS on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so I got carried away again, but you get my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my thoughts on AJAX specifically, and javascript in general are out
of the way I can turn to the subject at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;javascript rocks!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I made web pages was hmm, almost 8 years ago. A lot have changed
then. It is a wonderful thing to see how it is actually possible to make
usable UI on the web with javascript. Since I am now developing java2 EE apps
for a living I got into javascript. Its wonderful. And it seems a lot of
people think that because there are about as much js and AJAx framweorks as
there are commands in js, if not more. I knew about DOJO since it was
mentioned several time on the Django page. Trying to choose one seemd to me
next to impossible. So I did the only thing I could. I asked an expert. I
ended up with &lt;a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/"&gt;Prototypes&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://script.aculo.us/"&gt;Scriptalicous&lt;/a&gt;. The name alone would have convinced
me to us scriptalicous. The fact that Mark Pilgrim did part of the developing
just strengthened me in my decision. I have been using he framework for about
a week now and I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum this post up, javascript brings along a lot to the table, but it also
enforces a better table. I am a UI design enthusiast. I love my javascript.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Cascade delete in MySQL</title><link href="//2008/04/cascade-delete-in-mysql.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-04-25T20:03:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/04/cascade-delete-in-mysql.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I am actually getting payed to program instead of paying to program,
I find myself in greater need of practical information. Putting some of it on
my blog will help me keep all the knowledge in one place. To start off, I'll
mention Cascading delete in SQL. In the database schema there are 3 tables
used to store different objects. As there is a many to many relationship
between the the objects, there are relation tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Basic database layout" src="/static/images" title="/db-layout.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using cascading delete I can define that if an object is removed from its
table, all relation tables entries with that object id are also removed. Quite
handy. the way this achieves is MySQL is through the use of foreign keys. If I
define in the table members the unique id of a user as a foreign key I can
also define tell the RDMS to delete the entries in members where that foreign
key exist. Here is an example of the definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;` CREATE TABLE members (&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usr_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grp_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOREIGN KEY usr_id REFERENCE user (usr_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOREIGN KEY grp_id REFERENCE group (grp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE); `&lt;/p&gt;

friends. I was afraid I wont manage to go snowboarding this year, making it
the third year in a row. Luckily this weekend came along. As I posted before I
finally got around to buying my own board and I was looking forward to testing
it on real slopes. Thursday evening we left fro Kaprun in Austria. The
mountain we went boarding on is called the Kitsteinhorn. Its a 3000m high and
has a glacier so we knew we would have enough snow. The trip there is quite
long though. Its about 11 hours by car. We arrived in 6 in the morning. Quite
tired as you would imagine. The other group's car arrived 2 hours later. I
gave sleeping my best shot but by 9:30 I was wide awake. I just couldn't wait
any longer so I picked up my board and hit the slopes. The experience was
incredible. The board was just so great to ride on. Rent boards are beginner
boards. That means they are soft and forgiving. The downside is control. Once
you start going hard they get jumpy and are next to impossible to keep under
control. The board I bought is not the stiffest but its way stiffer then a
begginer's board. And I felt it right away. I had no problem controlling it at
speeds which would make me loose balance on beginners board. That's when I
noticed going fast also means going strong, and by strong I mean leg muscles.
Oh body did they hurt in the end of the day. The board gives back everything
you put into it, but it also demands you put energy into it. I could cruse at
low speeds but that just felt like driving a sports car at 50 km/h on a
straight road. No fun at all. Later on that day Erwin joined in. He was able
to give me a few small tips that immediately improved my cornering control and
speed. Its nice to know people in the know :). The rest of the weekend was
great. We snowboarded or skied all day, and had fun in the apartment at night.
Speaking of which, the apartment was huge. There were the 6 of us sleeping in
it but it never felt cramped. Compared to the tiny places you get in France
this was a grand palace. It will be hard for me to move back to the tiny
France standards next season. Or I could just stick with Austria. The weather
was quite acceptable. We had good snow showers, which led to really great
piste and off-piste rides. Unfortunately we also got snow during the day which
sometimes led to visibility so low all you could see was white with no
texture. All in all it was a great weekend and lots of fun. My board was all I
hoped and more and we all left with a taste for more.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sport"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>New gear</title><link href="//2008/03/new-gear.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-17T13:00:39+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/03/new-gear.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I spent a shit-load of money. Since I am going snowboarding I
figured it was time for me to get my own snowboard. Friday I visited 3 shops
but didn't find quite what I wanted. Not to mention I got very little
attention. Saturday, following Erwin's recommendation I went to a fourth shop.
After 7 hours there (poor Paula, I dragged her with me there) I left with a
shinning new board. The head of the snowboarding department there, Ed, gave me
all the attention, asked all the questions and tuned everything exactly to my
need. I ended up paying 100 Euro more then other places, but for that service
and that precise tunning it was well worth it. Sunday morning I went
snowboarding for 2 hours and man oh man. It was amazing. Never have I had such
an experience on a board. The faster I went, the better the board felt.
Everything felt right. The board was hard enough to carve really well, but
still communicate when I was nearing the limit. It was quick to react but very
stable. Stuff I couldn't pull off before I was doing now with confidence. It
was just an amazing experience. I can't wait to get to the real pistes this
weekend! For the gearheads here are the details on my new set: Snowboard:

good time for a post about how things are. Before I started working all I
heard from the working people is how they miss the student time. How much more
demanding working life is. It won't be an overstatment to say I went to my
first day a bit worried. My first day was like Christmas.  I got a mobile
phone, a laptop and a car. And that was pretty much it. The next two days have
been just as nice. Together with all the people who started working for
Getronics-Pinkroccade this month we had a 2 day into plan. Some presentation,
some group talks, and beer. Yes every building in the company has its own beer
tap with a barman. I like that. Did I mention, its free beer? The people I met
were intellegent, interesting and fun. If this is how most people in the
company are, I made a good choice coming to work here. From the forth day on,
and for the coming 2 weeks I'm in courses in Amersfoort. Its quite relaxed.
I'm doing the courses alone, with a tutor I can turn to for questions. My
tempo is quite high (im going almost at twice the expected rate) so I might be
finished earlier then expected. After I finish the courses I have a month of
stage to build some web app (interesting ideas for what exactly are welcome).
Then it will be time to actually work on real projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>Finally, I'm offically a university graduate</title><link href="//2008/03/finally-im-offically-a-university-graduate.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-17T12:37:20+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/03/finally-im-offically-a-university-graduate.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems like it took forever, but its finally finished.

slaap plaats te regelen in de buurt van Kaprun. Marcelo is op dit moment (of
starks) wat verder aan het zoeken. Ik heb wel 1 hotel gevonden daar waar in 1
site zijn er wel kamers vrij maar in een andere niet. De hotel naam is "Hotel
St. Hubertushof". De hotel ligt in een dorpje naast Kaprun. Aangezien dat er
is wel een mogelijkheid dat we geen slaapplek kunnen vinden heb ik wat verder
gezocht naar alternative wintersport lokaties. Ik heb de volgende paar

optie. &lt;a href="http://www.oadreizen.nl/reis/EVAT1309/OOSTENRIJK/Kitz

The senior class
has seen some major changes. Jorge Lorenzo, Andrea Dovizioso and Randy De
Puniet, the three big names from the 250 all moved to the gp class. Lorenzo as
Rossi's team mate. Edwards moved to the tech 3 Yamaha team, Melandri to
Ducatti replacing Cappirossi which in turn moved to Suzuki. The opening race
was held at night for the first time. Though I have to admit there is certain
magic to racing at night, it really is a huge waste of energy to keep that
much light going. I hope this will not begin a new trend in the MotoGP world.
The beginning of the race was very exciting. Pedrosas had a great start,
starting from third row he took the leading off the first corner. There was a
lot of action the first 10 rounds with Rossi, Jorge, Stoner, Pedrosa,
Dovizioso battling it out for the leading. Unfortunately At the 10'th round it
started to look like the previous season. Stoner was at the front, and slowly
but surely increasing his lead, Jorge was in second place. Rossi started to
loose places to finish 5th. Pedrosa took the last podium place. Dovizioso
ended 4th after a nice fight with Rossi in the last 2 rounds. It looks like
the 2008 season has the potential to be very exciting but it can also end up
with Stoner dominating once again. In 3 weeks we will see how things
developed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sport"></category></entry><entry><title>A quick update</title><link href="//2008/01/a-quick-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-20T08:51:28+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2008/01/a-quick-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I blogged, but as we are in Phuket at the moment and
the sun calls I will just write a quick update. We spent 10 days in Malaysia,
visiting Georgetown (Penang) and Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia proved to be a very
interesting place mainly because of the people. Malaysia has many minority
groups and a few religion. Islam is the dominant religion but there are quite
a lot of Buddhist and Hindu temple. We also saw some Daoist temples. The
distinct feeling in Malaysia is for people who are looking for an identity.
With a lot of minority groups and religion there is no clear feeling of unity
there. Kuala Lumpur proved to be a shopping haven. There are a lot of shopping
centers there are a few new ones being built. All in all Malaysia was an
interesting, but not spectacular experience. Moving back to Thailand we
settled in Phuket's Kata beach, where we will stay until the 25. Its time to
get some color before heading back to the cold. On the 25 we will take a night
bus to Bangkok. On the 28 at night we have our flight back to the Netherlands.

Or so we
had thought as we woke up. We headed towards the Grand Palace and the Temple
of the Emerald Buddha. Being the responsible travellers that we are, we
stopped in front of the palace to put on long pants and long sleeve shirts. As
we were clothing, a man approached us and started talking to us. I have read
on the lonely planet that if anyone starts talking to you, you should be
suspicious. It also said you should be double as suspicious if he says where
ever your going is closed. The man chatted with us for a few minutes then
asked if we were heading for the palace, because"It was closed". Paula
unfortunately did not yet read the boxed warning. The man told us it was
Buddha day, original name, and that the Grand Palace was close to foreigners
until 13:30. Only Thai people are allowed inside so they can pray in peace. He
came with a great plan for us to visit others site in the meantime and
miraculously, a tuk-tuk showed up just as he was finished. We said kindly no,
and that we would rather walk. He got all mad and walked away. Paula accused
me of being rude, and I was feeling quite bad about it. I decided I still want
to try the Palace, because I still suspected some trick. We approached what
seemed to be a gate. A man in a suite told us the same story and again a tuk-
tuk was there to take us on the trip "for just 10 bath"(that's about 23
cents). Behind the man in the suite was sitting a serious looking military
officer so I figured the guy was legit, and I was rude and so we hopped on the
tuk tuk. The first stop was the standing Buddha temple. The Buddha there is
very impressive and we were glad we went. Then the driver took us to a tailor
without us asking. The Tailor shop looked very professional, and the prices
were higher then average, which gave the whole place a serious feeling. Until
we said we are only shopping around and will not buy anything. The salesman
became agitated, refused to give us a written offer and pretty much threw us
out. The next stop was not a temple, but a jewelry shop. We got offered a fake
pearl necklace for 175 euro. Hurray. We didn't want to offend anyone by
calling the fake by its name so we just said it was expensive and that we
needed to think about it. The saleswoman was quite good at pushing."We are
only open to foreigners today", followed by "Buy for wife(Paula) as Christmas
present", then "If you not have cash we take credit cards". Unfortunately for
Ms pushy, both Paula and I are quite good at haggling. So we left without
buying anything. We told our driver no more shops, we want temple. To our
surprise he took us to one. It was the golden mount. The Golden Mount is an
artificial hill, with a huge stupa at the top. Though the stupa itself is not
that interesting, it is a great place to view the Bangkok skyline. By the time
we got back to our tuk tuk it was after 13:30 so we were ready to go back to
the Grand Palace. The driver however had other plans. He wanted us to go to a
shop. We told him that no, we don't want to, and that if he refuses its fine,
we will pay the 10 bath and find other means of transportation. The driver
would not be easily persuaded. He went first with the nice guy "Please help
me, I get gasoline like that", followed by the angry "I waited for you why you
not nice?!". We stood our ground so he just drove away, without taking his
money. After getting over the initial surprise, we had a good laugh. We got a
free tour around the city, spending a total of maybe 10 minutes in the shops,
and the Palace was only 10 min walking away. We got the feeling we scammed the
scammers! On the way to the Palace 3 people tried to start talking to us by
saying the palace is closed FROM 13:00, and as a final note we came across the
first guy, who ignored us, and the guy in the suite who was just telling two
Lebanese guys that the palace is closed from 13:00. We interrupted and
informed them what he had told us earlier, the guy vanished in the background
as we headed to what was the real entrance. Eventually we didn't go into the
Palace that day as by the time we arrived we had but one hour to explore it,
so we decided to go back another day. Our next few days in Bangkok have been
quite full. We saw the palace, and some huge shopping centers. We went to see
a movie, which quite amusing because before the film start everybody stands up
and a short video with pictures of the king is shown! We also gave up on tuk-
tuks and taxis. Taxi running on a meter turned out to be cheaper then a tuk-
tuk, only most of them try to scam you by driving in a very indirect route. So
we did the only thing left, we took the bus. That turned out to be a great
idea, because quite frankly, they are incredible easy to use, ride frequently,
and there are so many of them, you almost never need to change buses no matter
where your going. Bangkok was fun, but I really wanted to get my ass on some
beach. and so on the 21 of December we boarded the night bus to Krabi, with
the plan to spent xmas on Raily beach. The lonely planet describes it as the
most beautiful beach in Thailand. A friend of ours (Yes Aharale I mean you!)
spent a whole month there and was totally in love with it. To say we had high
expectations would be an understatement. As high as out expectations were, the
disappointment was way bigger. The surrounding is amazing, but the beach
itself is pretty standard. There were only red, fat drunken English, sometimes
with their red, fat annoying kids. Garbage was everywhere. And as a final
piece everything was crazily over expansive. Every hotel claimed to be full,
except for the one room they could show us. Then another room became magically
available after we refused the first. You get the general idea. After 3 long
agonizing hours on Raily we left. I have located on the lonely plant a much
promising little island, called Ko Bulon Lae. It was only another day's
traveling away! Paula didnt know if she loved me for pulling her from Raily or
hated me for making her travel another day. The next day at noon, when we
finally got to Bulon Lae she knew she loved me. We found azure water, white
yellow beach, and an amazing little island. Bulon Lae is quite small, with
only a few resorts to stay in. And when I say resort I mean a couple of
bungalows and a small restaurant/bar/reception. it was perfect! We had a great
time on Bulon Lae. We ate well, we had a nice snorkel trip, we ate well, we
hung on the beach. Oh and the food was really good. We spent 6 days on that
small charming Island then moved on to Ko Tarutao national park. The national
park contains several islands, the biggest of which is Ko Tarutao. The place
most people end up in, however, is Ko Lipe, which is where we went to. We were
planning on using Ko Lipe as a spring board to one of the park's other
islands, Ko Adang. We were under the impression this island would be almost
completely deserted. We were planning on having a new year's eve all alone.
Were we ever wrong. Thailand it seems share the same months as we do, only
their calendar year is different. So when we have new year, they to, have new
year. The Island's only camp site was packed full of Thai people. We came
there with a water supply, food, and cooking material, only to be confronted
by some bungalows and a restaurant. Oh well. It was not what we expected but
we had a blast. Most amazing of all was the snorkeling there. We saw a sea
turtle! It was so lovely, so beautiful, and as we found out later so very
rare. Camping there was great. Our tent was right on the beach, which was
beautiful. We had a campfire right next to the sea every evening. It was a lot
of fun, and it gave us both a lot of energy. On the 2nd of January we moved
back to Lipe. Lipe, smaller then Bulon Lae is much more touristic. It has some
great beaches, and very nice restaurants. It also has some diving schools
offering dives in the national park. After debating about it for around 5
seconds we decided to take a diving trip. Man was it worth it. The visibility
was great, the corals were great, and we saw some wonderful marine life. A
pack of Barracudas and a Lion fish are my favourites. Yesterday we left Ko
Lipe and Thaliand and got to Malaysia. We will be spending the next couple of
days in Georgetown, then Kula Lumpur, before our return to Thailand for some
final beaches and some shopping.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Cambodia Experience</title><link href="//2007/12/cambodia-experience.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-21T14:15:48+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/12/cambodia-experience.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our last day in Siem Reap we went to the floating village. The place is an
interesting place and some proof of human adaptation. The lake, in which the
village floats, has a huge difference in water level between the seasons. To
compensate for this houses were built on bamboo rafts so they move with the
water level. It really is fascinating to see how people live on what is almost
a scene out of "Water World", well without the bad acting. And at a lower
budget. Fishnet bellow the house, boats serving as a mini-market floating
around. It's an ado to human adaptation, at least as I see it. Then we left
for Phnom Phen. Stayed a night and left for Kratie. If you haven't heard the
name, don't be surprised. Its a small town with nothing much in it. But its on
the Mekong next to where the Irrawaddy dolphins live. For those of you who
don't know it, its sweat water dolphins. We found a hotel we thought was
pretty good, went for diner and then to bed. then it became interesting. We
were sitting with our books when we both noticed small animals jumping on our
books. I didn't give it a second thought and dismissed it as some weird
tropical bug. Paula however, being the keen biologist that she is, recognized
them as flees. "I am not sleeping in a bed with flees!". So I went to the
reception and tried to explain to the non-english-capable-staff that we had
flees. I got a bottle of shampoo. I tried again. This time I was more
successful in getting through that it was, in fact, some sort of bug. So I got
a bug spray. I tried to explain this doesn't kill flees but failed miserably.
At this point one of the small crowd that has gathered around me had the
brilliant idea of actually calling someone who can speak English. With this
new translator I got through that it was actually flees that we were facing.
The staff was not convinced, they wanted to see the flees for themselves. And
so back to the room we went: me, the translator, and 3 staff members. Of
course it was next to impossible to see any flees. They also said they had no
room available. When we said we would leave, a room became available. It also
had flees. even more so. enough for me to show the stuff. So late at night,
with the whole town closed we went into the street, bags and all and hurried
to the first hotel we found, which luckily was around the corner. It didn't
have flees. It did have air-co, and double the price. But we figured it beats
getting flees. After our nightly escapade we were all ready to see some
dolphins. After a short motor ride we got to the dock, where we hired a boat,
and a guide and went dolphin searching. It was wonderful to see them. There is
just something about dolphins that make me feel all warm inside. we spent
about 3 hours looking around with dolphins popping up close and far, in pairs,
solo. We even got to see them play here and there. It was an uplifting
experience in all manners. After that Cambodia seemed like a much nicer place.
The next day we went back to Phnom Phen and I prepared myself mentally for our
following day in Phnom Phen. We will be going to Tuol Slang, a.k.a. S-21 and
the killing fields. It was even more difficult than I imagined. S-21 was a
school before it was transformed into a prison by the Khmer Rouge. more then
17,000 people were sent there during the two years of the Khmer rouge regime.
6 walked out. It is a horrible place. Even now, after 30 years it seems like
you can feel the pain and horror echoing back from the walls that once where
home for children's dreams. The people were not executed in S-21. Instead they
were set on trucks and sent to a field about 15km outside of Phnom Phen. Hence
the name. It is as of yet unclear how many of these killing fields actually
exist. It is a surreal experience to wonder the peaceful groove, full of trees
and small holes. to think of the horrors that took place there. People were
not shot, because bullets costs money. They were punched to death. Mothers
watched as their babies were slammed into trees until they died. Then the
mothers were mascaraed.  I do not want to go into it any further. Instead I
wish to note two more things about the place. In S-21 there are paintings made
by one of the prisoners. the painting were comissioned by the wardens to
describe the different types of torture. One of the paintings shows a method
of torture which has been on the news lately, the so called "Water Boarding".
the method the America administration claims is not torture. The second is a
sentence that was written on a wall in a cell block. "We cry about the past
but do nothing for the present". Think about it. The next day we took the bus
from Phnom Phen to Bangkok. This time the border crossing went smooth. We got
what we were promised. By 21:30 we were eating Masiman with rice in an alley
of Khao San road.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>The Angkor</title><link href="//2007/12/the-angkor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-21T11:02:59+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/12/the-angkor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are few places in the world who's name alone is inspiring. The Angkor
Wat is definitely one of those places. After spending 3 days there I can
completely understand why. Angkor, the old capital of the Khmer empire is a
huge complex. Its about 40 km from the north most temple ruins to the south
most. In this big area there are hundreds of temples, the most known, and the
biggest is the Angkor Wat. It is quite hard to grasp just how immense it is.
Unlike churches, it does not have one big hall. To understand how big it is
one has to be standing outside it. As we understand it is the biggest religion
building in the world. The first two days in the Angkor we spend on bicycle,
visiting the more central located temples. Aside from the Angkor Wat we
visited the Bayon in Angkor Thom, Pre Rub, and some more less known temples.
On a third day we took a TukTuk (3 wheeled taxi) for some temples that were
far of. The Angkor really grows on you. In the end of the third day we had a
hard time saying goodbye. It is hard to explain in words just how magical the
place feels. Walking in ancient temples, some reclaimed by man, some are still
covered in jungle, you can completely loose yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Cambodian border experience</title><link href="//2007/12/cambodian-border-experience.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-07T11:59:37+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/12/cambodian-border-experience.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we crossed the Cambodian border, after falling victim to several
scams in one ticket. We bought a fairly expansive ticket from Chiang Mai to
Siam Reap(the city next to the Angkor Wat). We were promised to buses in
Thailand and good buses in Cambodia. We didn't get the bus we were promised
from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. A pickup truck brought us to a gas station where a
bus, which looked like it was at least 20 years old, was waiting for us.
Somehow it managed to reach Bangkok in time for our connection bus. The bus
from Bangkok to the border was even worse. We got picked up from a highway
junction. The bus rattled and was pretty cramped. At the border they tried to
scam us into paying twice the visa price. We also had to wait for about two
hours at a restaurant while some guy went with most peoples passport, and
their money to arrange said visas. We said we arrange it ourself at the
border. When we got to the actual border we were lead, by one of the tour
group people to the clerk where we could buy the visa. It said very clearly
above him "tourist visa 20$, normal visa 25$". We knew from the lonely planet
that tourist was 20 and business was 25. The guy from the tour company, and
the clerk changed a few quick sentences, and it seemed then that it was 25$,
because "a tourist visa is just for one day" Feeling we did the best we could
we payed the extra 5$ each. One thing I'm sure of. I'm going to file an
official complain with the tourist police as soon as we get back to Thailand.
Its not that much money, viewed in the total budget of the trip, but it can
really ruin your day, and there is no real reason for it. After waiting in
line for 3/4 of an hour we were finally in Cambodia. Then we were made to wait
with the whole group for a bus that would take us to Siem Reap. We have heard
about buses taking people to guest houses so the drivers can get commission,
and after a short talk with the tour operator that accompanied us it became
clear that we were gonna be on just such a bus. "I have no control over where
he stops, I'm in the Thailand side" He the proceeded to cross the border with
no passport and no problem. The scene on the Cambodian side is really
something. It feels like the wild west, like no man's land. Lots of shady
types walking around. You can almost smell the criminality in the air. I
wanted to get out of there as fast as we could. Finally a bus came. It looked
like it would break down any minute. Paula noticed all the "problematic
people", that is those who tried to arrange the visa for themselves, were
singled out to get on the bus, so she decided no matter what we are not
getting on that bus. I reasoned that there are 25 people on the bus, there
were only 7 problematic people in total. Paula insisted, and I, being the
loving guy that I am, stood by her and refused to get on the bus. After
argueing with a few people we were left to be, and the bus left. Another half
hour passed and nothing happend. I decided it was time for me to take some
action, so locating the nicest looking guy I walked over, with a big phony
smile and asked very politly when the hell are we getting the fuck out of
here. My exact words might have been somewhat nicer, but I think this better
describe my feelings at the moment. "The other bus is broken so we need to see
what happens, there might not be another bus today, but we will take care of
you." I gave the guy 10 minutes to find out when, if at all, this mistery,
maybe broken, bus is coming. Of course he didn't get back to me so after a
quarter of an hour I walked to him, smiling a bit less, but still being nice,
and asked again about transportation. "Bus not coming, so I have arranged a
Taxi for you" I heard a few minutes ago how some tried to stuff 8 backpackers
in one regular 4 door car taxi. "How big is the taxi, and how many people will
go in it?" I asked. "Regular car, with 4 people". I was getting a bit
optimistic. a few minutes later a Toyota Camry pulled next to us and we were
shown to it together with an American couple. After being told about 10 times
the taxi has already been payed for we left for Siem Reap. There were still
about 10 people waiting for transportation when we left. About 2 km from the
border we passed the bus that Paula didn't want to take. It looked like it was
broken. The passengers were outside, the driver was looking into the engine. I
was so glad Paula decided we shouldn't take that bus. I have no idea if these
people made it to Siem Reap that evening. At around 9 pm we got to Siem Reap,
after 26 hours of traveling. It took us a few tries but we found a nice guest
house to stay in and so here we are. I consider myself an experience traveler.
I have crossed border cross land before, and I have never had it as bad as the
Cambodian border. I really was on the verge of just saying "Fuck it, lets go
back to Thailand and do Malaysia instead."It felt like you were being smuggled
into Cambodia by the Mafia. The worst part is, that the Cambodian government
is keeping it like that thanks to a certain airway company bribing a certain
official to keep this statues quo as long as possible. You can guess why I'm
sure. Siem Reap luckily has done a bit to repair the damage done by the border
crossing. The people are nice and polite, though the tuktuk drivers jump you
whenever you so any sign of an intention to move from one place to another.
Tomorrow we are gonna start exploring the Angkor Wat. We really are looking
forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Chiang Mai and the north</title><link href="//2007/12/chiang-mai-and-the-north.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-07T11:17:53+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/12/chiang-mai-and-the-north.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The north of Thailand, so much to do so little time. Like I wrote earlier we
had to narrow it down. We knew we had about a week so we devised a plan to
fill the days as best we could. The first day was dedicated into what, in my
opinion, is one the best things in Thailand . Thai food. The Thai kitchen is
incredibly rich in taste and has a fresh feeling to it. we both are great fan
of Thai food so we decided its time we knew how to make some ourself. The
first lesson was the material so we went to the local market for a fast lesson
on the different sort of rice, noodle, vegetables and meat that goes into Thai
dishes. After some shopping we got a ride to the school. The class was
smallish (about 8 of us) so there was enough time for individual attention.
Our teacher was really funny, mostly because of the way he laughed at his own
jokes. at least once every 5 minutes he would tell a joke, which non of us
understood, but he had to laugh so hard at his own jokes it was really funny.
Cooking was fun to. we learned how to make home made Curry, and how to cook
several dishes (Yes Aharle we learned to make Massman). We even cooked
adventure style. That is set fire to the food in the wak. At the end of the
day we had the pleasure of eating what we cooked. To our surprise it actually
tasted remotely like real Thai food, which for a first time, made us both
quite happy. It also filled us up very well. With a full stomach we rolled
into our guest house to book a 3 day trek. They were a few people short so
they said they will let us know in the morning if we are leaving or not.
Hoping for the best but expecting the worse we made a backup plan of going
downhill mountain biking instead. The trek didn't go through the next morning,
"But tomorrow we go for sure" we were promised. So we went mountain biking.
And boy was that fun. We both have mountain biked before, but never really did
hard core downhill. Somehow we got ourselves into an advance level path, which
is parallel to black slopes in winter sports. We got body armor, helmets, knee
and elbow protection. At this point Paula was starting to get stressed. Then
our guide started talking about all the bad things that could happen. It
didn't really help that, being an American he probably over exaggerated a lot
of things. Paula was starting to get real doubts about our ability to finish
this route in one piece. We got on the bike, and then things really got worse.
The first part of the route must have been the most evil piece of terrain I
have ever tried to negotiate with a bike. Hell, it looked so evil I would have
thought twice before attempting it on foot. Roots, logs, rocks, in all shapes
and sized. And this on a 30 to 40 degree angel. Luckily for me I had quite a
good bike (some sort of downhill mongoose bike that were real heavy duty) so I
successfully negotiated the terrain. Paula had the misfortune of having a
crappy bike, with a front brake that could be either off, or full on. Combine
that with the fright she got from our guide, and you see her situation. Just
as we were considering maybe we did take a bite to big for us to chew, the
route became much friendlier. That hellish descent, the first part of the
route, is ,as it turned out, the worst part. We got on a few dirt roads, then
some more hard core descents, but nothing as long as that first part. By the
end of the day I was feeling quite confident on the bike. And my arm muscles
hurt like hell. All those downhill mountain bikers in movies, they all have
thick muscular arms. I always figured it was part of having a sporty life, or
going to the gym. I had no idea how hard your arms are actually working when
doing serious downhill mountain biking. I figured it would be like
snowboarding. Just try not to fall while gravity does the rest. By the end of
the day my shoulders were done, but man was it fun! Paula also had a blast.
Despite the rotten start. I cant wait to try it again. Maybe throw in a few
ramps for jumps next time. When we got back to the guest house we heard there
were still not enough people to go to the trek tomorrow. "But the day after
tomorrow we go for sure". Having heard that before we decided to take matters
into our own hands. We sat down with the lonely planet and chose what we
really wanted to see in the north of Thailand. We made a 4 day plan, and the
next morning we got up, checked out and rented a motorbike for four days. At
first I was considering renting a dirt bike, to enable us to go off road. But
with a passenger, and a fairly large bag it would have been nothing short of
madness. So we got ourselves a chopper. At least as far as choppers go in
Thailand. You see, here its all small engines so our 400cc Honda Steed was a
real heavy motorcycle. I have to admit the bike impressed me in a very
positive way. With lots of torque at low revs, it had no problem negotiating
the steep climbs we faced. We first headed to the northward to Chiang Dao, to
visit holly caves. The caves are host to a Buddha temple, and are nice to see
as a natural phenomena. From Chiang Dao we headed east towards Pai, where we
planned on spending the night. The road is only 200km but it took us over 4
hours to complete, an it had nothing to do with the road quality. This road,
and the road we will be taking for the next 3 days were really bike heaven.
Lots of curves, lots of hairpins, it was a lot of fun to ride. Paula was also
having a blast. A chopper doesn't only give the passenger more comfort, it
also sets him quite high, which meant she could see more then the back of my
helmet. The next day, we drove from Pai to Mae Hong Son. On the way we stopped
at the Coffin caves. Inside this rather large cave complex coffins have been
found which have been dated back to 1200-2200 years ago. It is still unclear
who made them, but the small number of them suggests it was reserved for very
specific individuals. The coffins are very long logs (5-9m in length) cut in
the middle lengthwise, then hollowed out (basically resembling a long, round
canoe) and suspended on logs. The whole experience of caving and ancient
relics is quite exciting I have to admit. To get around in the cave one must
use a boat. This adds even more to the sense of adventure and exploration when
visiting the cave. Unfortunately, all this also means a lot of people come to
visit. For the first time in our trip we were surrounded by tourists, most of
whom, to my surprise were Israelis. That did damage the experience a bit, but
it was still amazing. At sunset we arrived at Mae Hong Son. Our third day was
spent in the area of Mae Hong Son. We started by going with a boat to a Karen
long neck tribe village. The experience was not quite what I had expected. for
some reason I was expecting a quite, almost intimate meeting with the tribe.
What I got was a street market which happened to be run by women, some of them
are long neck. Don't get me wrong, it is very interesting to see these people,
and to hear about their customs. There was however not a lot of reality in it.
As soon as they spot a camera they switch to posing mode. So catching them
natural is quite the challenge. Seeing then acting naturally is also not easy,
but we finally manged, thanks to Paula, and her passion for kids. After taking
a snap of a kid she showed him the picture she made. She then proceeded to try
and teach him how to make a picture with the camera. Within 10 seconds she was
surrounded by kids, all trying to make pictures and view them, at the same
time. It was wonderful to see. The tribe's people around also were amused. It
helped dismiss a bit of the stiffnes you felt by them when you were
approching. After that, Paula managed to get some better shots of the tribes
people. We got back to town hopped on the bike and went to visit the summer
palace. While actually locating the palace grounds we failed to actually find
the palace in it. We pretyt much covered all the roads inside but there was no
palace to be found. There was however a nice collection of animals that would
not shame any medium scale zoo. Included in that collection is a miniature
leopard. Sizing at about 1.2m long, it looks more like a house cat on steroids
with a cool fur. Until he opens his mouth. Damn there are some sharp teeth
inside. Resisting the urge to try and reach inside to pet them, we got back on
the bike and continued to a village on the Lao border. The village, is known
for its tea plantations (recently before that it was for the opium). Drank a
cup of tea and started heading back to Mae Hong Son. We nearly froze. You
think of Thailand you think of warm, and sun. Well we found out the north can
be quite cold. The night at Pai the temperatures dropped to 10 degrees. But at
least we weren't riding. Now the temperature was going in that direction,
while we were on the bike. It took me 10 minutes in a hot shower to feel all
warm again. On the last day we woke up quite early as we needed to cover all
the distance back to Chiang Mai in one day. Expecting the cold we wore all our
cloths. We looked like stuffed teddy bears, but at least we weren't cold. On
the way to Chiang Mai, we stopped at the top of the highest mountain in
Thailand, measured at 2565m. Getting to the top is a matter of following the
road there. We arrived in Chiang Mai in time for diner. Traveling on a bike
has proven to be lots of fun. Although non of the paths we took are unique,
doing them on a bike is quite rare. We got a lot of friendly waves and smiles
from locals, and a lot of attention from kids on the way. Being on a bike puts
you out there with the people, not closed inside a box. If it gets cold, you
feel it. If it rains, you get wet. Then again, people notice you more, and you
get a lot more contact with the people and the surrounding. The tale of
crossing the Cambodian border will be told in the next post. Oh and once
again, gallery has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="sport"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>A trip through the capitals</title><link href="//2007/11/a-trip-through-the-capitals.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-28T09:59:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/11/a-trip-through-the-capitals.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Diving has not been to me all that I had expected it to be. I was actually
waiting for my mind to be blown away, all my old hobbies forgotten and a new
obsession to be introduced. Instead what I found was a charming, relaxing
experience that offers very little in the adrenaline department, but a lot on
the animal viewing department. I did not expect me to get all excited about
seeing a shark. Its just a really large fish after all. Yet, when I did see a
shark, from quite close by actually, I was excited. Not in fear mind you, but
in awe. The movements so strong and sure, a creature in total dominance of
itself and its surrounding. It really was all that and more. Diving has not
proven to be my new adrenaline shot, but in a sense it is something better.
Something that I can't quite get in any other sport. After finishing the
course we started our trip north, with our final stop Chiang Mai. On the way
we passed through all the capitals of Thailand, old and new. From Koh tao we
travelled to Bangkok. It was not our intention to stay there, just to spend
the night as a stop on our way north. In the morning we were confronted, for
the first time in Thailand, by tourist hassles. We wanted a taxi or a tuktuk
to the bus station. No taxi would take us with the meter. they all wanted a
flat price of 300 Bath (around 6 euro). Having travelled before we knew that
means the price is way to high, so after walking a bit further from the
tourist area, we found a taxi that would take us with a meter. It was 91 Bath
to the bus station. Two hours later we were in Ayutthaya, the old capital, and
the seat of power for the Siam kings. Ayutthaya is not a pretty place, but it
has around 400 temple ruins spread amongst its modern houses. Some of these
are nothing more then a low square wall about 3 meter long and 3 meter wide.
Others are tall Stupas and Prangs. To manage to see most of it, we rented a
scooter. I have had a motorcycle before so I knew how to drive with gear.
These scooters have a gear box that feels like it was made to be used with
slippers. Instead of the usual small lever, there is a pedal for shifting up,
and one for shifting down, making it easy to shift with sandals. Luckily
because man it was hot! I have not had shows on since we left china. The
temples of Ayutthaya have been quite impressive and by the day's end we
managed to see pretty much all that we wanted. so we headed north to Lopburi.
Lopburi is a small town. It has nothing really going for it, except once a
year. They have a lot of monkeys there. Once a year top chefs from Bangkok
cook a king's meal for the monkeys, who ravage the tables set for them. That's
what we came to see, and it was worth passing by for. Those of you who
remember our trip in Kenya know we had a run with monkeys in the past, so we
were more careful these time. They are wild animals, and they really have big
teeth. Seeing a monkey trying to open a can of Coke is actually quite amusing.
And seeing them running around with pasta in their mouth is hilarious. We left
the same day. Arriving finally in Sukothai, the even older capital of
Thailand. It also has a lot of ruined temple and an impressive old city. Again
we rented a scooter and went touring. The Ayutthaya temples were destroyed by
the Burmese army in the 18th century, the Buddhas there beheaded. It was nice
to finally see Buddha images with the head on. We also saw the biggest Buddha
as of yet. 16m tall and 9m wide sitting Buddha. The sculpture is in a room
just barely bug enough to hold it, making it look even bigger. It is quite
impressive. In Sukothai we also learned about the different posture of the
Buddha images, and what they all means. I was again confronted by just how
little I know about eastern religion and believes. It is a shame, as Buddhism
and Hinduism are both very large religions. I definitely should take some time
to learn more about them. Finally, having seen all the old capitals, we took
the bus to Chiang Mai and here we are now. Chiang Mai has a lot to offer. So
much in fact that we are taking a whole day just to decide what we want to do
here. We want to take a cooking course, we want to ride mountain bikes, we
want to trek, we want to raft, we want to see the hill tribes, we want ...,
the list just goes on and on. Our time unfortunately, does not. So we will
have to cut a few things out of the plan, trim some days of several
activities, and find a way in between. In about one week we need to be heading
into Cambodia. Ill let you know how it all turned out :) Last, but not least,
the gallery page has been updated. in the trip album ther eis an album called
new. We will upload the new pictures here, moving them out each time before
loading new pictures. This should make it easier to see which pictures are the

exactly how I feel when I try to tell someone about Hong Kong. To describe
Hong Kong in words would be like trying to explain to a blind man why the
color red is much more vivid then gray. It is simply impossible. You can try,
but one has to see, one has to feel for one self before it is understood. This
all may sound a bit over dramatic but it is genuinely how I feel about Hong
Kong. The place, for me, has a certain magic, that cant really be described.
Cities have vibes, and Hong Kong's vibe is nothing short of magic. Watching
Hong Kong from Victoria Peak at night is not only breathtaking but also
romantic. For me it also feels me with pride. Look at this wonderful towers,
this show of beauty. Its all made by men. We made it, not nature. And that is
something very few places manage to do. The city feels like it was designed to
live in. It has air-walks, and parks, and trees all intertwined with huge
skyscrapers. There are butterflies and serious men in suites, rich and poor,
eastern and western, its just all there. There is charm to be found almost in
every corner we have seen. As wonderful as the time we had in Hong Kong was,
it was time to move along. After 5 wonderful days in Hong Kong, we boarded the
plane and flew to Bangkok. Our original plan was to go to the north of
Thailand, followed by Cambodia, and then finish in the south of Thailand. We
both were a bit tired after 3 weeks in China so we though a small stop at a
beach for a few days will be good. On the plane we decided to change a few
days at the beach to the diving course we were planning on doing anyway. We
chose Ko Tao as our destination. So here we are now on a tropical isle, about
to take our first shallow water dive today.

this way as I rarely get so excited about cities. Hong Kong for me was always

sure there are very nice Chinese people (our hostel staff is a good example),
but for the most, they are just very rude people. I get more and more the
feeling that the greatness that came out of China is more the exception then
the rule. I wonder how Hong Kong will be like.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category></entry><entry><title>The Terra cota army</title><link href="//2007/11/the-terra-cota-army.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-06T03:41:48+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/11/the-terra-cota-army.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The reason we actually came to Xi'an was to view the terra cota army.
Yesterday we finally did it. The sight of it has left us amazed. The terra
cota army was made for the burial of emperor Qin. Qin was the first to rule
over the whole of china. There were 5 kingdoms in china then. He has conquered
them all, creating the basis for what is modern day China. It is assumed he
believed he would continue to rule even after his death and that this army was
built for him to have soldiers to command after his death. The site is made
out of 3 pits. Pit 1 is the biggest and most impressive, hosting waht is
assumed to be a total of about 6000 warriors. Pit 2 was unfortunetl closed
when we were visiting. Pit 3 contains 72 warriors, most of them high ranking
officers, so it is assumed it was the command post. Pit 1 really is mind
bogging. It is huge, and there are just so many warriors there it is amazing,
and it is not yet fully discovered yet. We were really taken by it. I find it
hard to express in words the awe that we felt gazing upon them. Considering
this is all more then 2000 years old makes it even more amazing. The details
are amazing. No two warriors have the same face! The Chinese call it the 8th
world wonder and I find it hard to dispute. The amount of work, and riches
that went into making them is hard to imagine. The burial place of the emperor
himself is expected to be amazing as well, but it is still in the first phases
of excavation so there isnt anything to see there yet. The terra cota army
alone is worth a visit to Xi'an, and maybe even a detour into china if your in
the neighborhood. It is huge, it is impressive, and it is a sight that will
remain with you long after the trip becomes a far memory.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Photo update</title><link href="//2007/11/photo-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-03T16:09:59+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/11/photo-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our photo album on my gallery page has been updated.

My impression of the Chinese might be
wrong then, but so far it is really a people of duality. They are nice people
but about as polite as a pack of starving hyenas on the queue to the free
antelope steakhouse. Example: We got into the metro station and queued behind
the guy buying he tickets. The two Chinese dudes behind us just casually walk
by us and stood in line before us. I made some cavemen grumbling noise they
turned, looked up (It helps being twice the size) smiled and walked behind us
to queue properly. The guy was finished and we were about to take a step
towards the register when this Chinese woman, coming just in tried to walk in
front of us and to the register! I set my arm in her way, making that
grumbling noise again. she looked up at me, smiled said sorry and got in line.
That was the worse part of it all. She said sorry, which means she knows its
wrong, but she just went ahead and done it anyway. And this is just one in
many cases we encounter this, each day. They seem to be living in a bubble of
"Me Me Me" and the rest can go screw themselves. It might be only the Beijing
Chinese. I'm not sure. Ill know in a few days when I have been to Xi'an for a
while.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Forbidden city and the communist emperor</title><link href="//2007/11/forbidden-city-and-the-communist-emperor.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-11-01T09:52:05+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/11/forbidden-city-and-the-communist-emperor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago we visited the forbidden city. The place sure justifies the
city part. To call it a palace will be an insult to the shear size of the
place. It is probably bigger then most average size villages. For you dutch
readers, its probably slightly bigger then the center of Leiden. In
contradiction to European palaces of having one major building with a few
small ones, the forbidden city is almost a maze of large and small buildings
with walls in between. Less then half of it is open to the public and yet
after spending a whole day there we still did not manage to see all of the
public areas. It really is that big. The attention to detail is amazing. They
had about 500 years to perfect it, and it looks like they really took the
time. Even the stone sewer covers are nicely decorated. Every piece of wall,
roof, window and stair has been given attention. You get the feeling that if
an area is plain looking its like that because it was the intention, not for
lack of attention, or time. All that said there are some pointers the Chinese
government could use to make this place even more interesting to visit. Hiring
someone that can actually speak English as a language, and not just translate
Chinese text for once. A lot of time when reading the signs next to the
building you can see it is just literally translated from Chinese. The other
place where improvement can be made is in the content. Every building had
pretty much the same sign. It was so bad we eventually started to make jokes
about it. Every building was built in the Ming dynasty and had a name with
Harmony, Longevity and/or some season name in it. Each one was rebuilt during
the Qing dynasty, renamed twice using the same naming rule. And that's about
it. Only 3 buildings actually had more than that on their sign. A place with
500 years of history probably has more to say about its buildings one might
think. Not that this will diminish the experience, which is amazing. Yesterday
we went to the Mao memorial. His body is kept there for all to walk by and
admire. It is an experience you have to see when in China. Paula and I got the
feeling this is their emperor. Its like the Chinese need an emperor, and in
the communist time, the only possible emperor is Mao.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Some things are better the way they are</title><link href="//2007/10/some-things-are-better-the-way-they-are.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-29T11:46:48+01:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/10/some-things-are-better-the-way-they-are.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a hip Chinese restaurant jut under our hotel.

only it has tea instead of coffee. All the hip Chinese where helping
themselves to one, so I figured I'd go with the flow. What can I say. Some

Only after landing in China did
it sunk in that I am, actually going there. For the first time in my life I
was in a place where I could not read anything. Well unless they had some
small English translation bellow, but that's beside the point. It was all
overwhelming. We took the rich man way and got a taxi to our hotel. After a
short break we decided to play the good tourists and wait straight for
Tian'anmen square. Apparently its the biggest public square in the world. and
to be honest I believe it. Its huge. And I mean Huge with a capital H. Looking
around we noticed how relax everybody was. There were police officers around,
but it did not feel imposing. as a western its not easy to forget the sights
of the student in front of the tank in this square. Another thing which I
found quite ironic is a monument in the middle of the square. Its called the
"Obelisk for the people's heroes" and is closed to the public, who can only
see it from afar. Feeling good about ourselfs we went duck hunting, Peking
style. We didn't find the restaurant the Lonely planet recommended so we got
into some place that looked nice. We didn't know it at the time but we got our
wallets drained there with the prices. We figured it was OK, later we found
out we got the tourist menu, and basically just for the duck we payed what is
normal for a full meal. Oh well, first day mistakes. We closed our first day
with booking a trip to the great wall for the next day, leaving at 6 in the
morning. So we went to bed. Being the dutch people that we are, we were 5
minutes before time. Everybody else of course, was late. We managed to get
some sleep on the way there. Its about a 4 hour trip from Beijing to the part
of the wall we were going to see. We chose a relatively not touristic part of
the wall that also offers a one way hike, for 4 hours across the wall, ending
at another point. The wall is, well, great. Actually great does not do it
justice. It is like a huge stone serpent stretched across the hill top for as
far as the eye could see. It was an amazing experience walking on this wall of
myth and legend. Luck was with us and we got good weather. I would love to
keep on saying how amazing it all is, but it really is something one must see
and feel for oneself to understand. Getting back late in the evening we
collapsed on the bed. Yesterday we decided to take it down a nudge and just go
about the town. The temple of heaven park, with its symbolic temple of good
harvest in its center was our choice for the day's activity. The park has a
lovely atmosphere to it. Lots of old people, doing their thing. Singing,
dancing, playing music, playing cards, or just talking. It was a quite an
uplifting experience. From the park we went to Silk road, which is actually a
big, multiple-floored building with vendors,  selling everything, including
silk. Paula was checking out some silk so she can have some custom made for
her sister and/or mother. Then we decided to check the price of read- made
jackets. Paula started negotiating with the sales woman. She started at 1200
yuan (120 euro). We figured by that start price we can probably go to 400-500
the lowest. We were approaching to closing when a wonderful American woman
heard us, walked over and said she had paid 210 yuan for just such a jacket at
another vendor. The sales woman was not really happy with that, so she started
going down to 400. We decided to leave. She did went down to 210. We didn't
buy the jacket but we learned another lesson about what price to expect in
china. We were used to middle east 40-50% of the price. It seems here its 20%.
After a day at the park, and some price negotiations, we decided to explore
our hoel's surrounding. I have been complaining about the lack of coffee since
we arrived. It seems Chinese are not big on coffee, so finding coffee was
hard. And so it turns out we have a Starbucks 2 min walk from our hotel. Damn.
I'm not big on Starbucks, but its coffee, and I need my coffee. We also bought
some Nescafe for the hotel. They only give you tea in ours. Today we took the
bus to the summer palace. That on its own is an experience. Trying to not only
tell the conductor, who does not a speak of word of English, not only where
you are going, but also to let you know when to get out can be a challenge.
Though with some good spirit and some cave men communication techniques,
pointing and making "hmm" sounds we managed to get there. The weather
unfortunately was grey and cold. This being the summer palace, it was less
impressive than it could have been. That is not to say that it wasn't because
it is. The shear size of it is astonishing. The palace is made out of several
complexes each with its own purpose. The palace is located next to a lake, who
at one point was increased in size and made deeper, to please the emperor of
the time. It is clear to see that this is a house made for a ruler with no end
to his resources. Its beautifully made, with a lot of attention to detail. We
also had some charming moment with the locals. We stopped to eat lunch at one
of the terraces. There was an old man there, drawing Chinese letters on the
ground. He approached us and to our surprise asked in perfect English if we
were American. We answered that actually no, we aren't. We started a
conversation with him. Mr. Tong has taught us some thing about Chinese
symbols, and also talked a bit about himself. It was all so very charming. The
second streak of luck with the locals was just as we were about to leave. We
peered into one of the complexes and were immediately pulled in by 3 young
Chinese girls who in heavily accented English told us about this complex,
pulling us from one room to the next. It was all so lovely and charming. They
are, it turned out, from a private school and they practice there every
weekend with presentation in English. I got a notebook and a pen, and they
asked for my name, nationality and if I had any recommendations. Then they ran
giggling, only to come back with a friend and to take their picture with us.
Taking another challenging bus back to Beijing. this time the driver forgot us
and didn't tell us when to get out. Luckily Paula's eagle eyes caught the
metro station we wanted to get out at and we got out of the bus just in time.
It has occurred to me that the Chinese people have a sort of duality. At least
in my impression so far. On the one side they are very friendly and very
helpful. On the other side they will rip you off any way they can. I wonder if
this is a semi first impression, or if I'm on to something here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Me"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>99 days</title><link href="//2007/10/99-days.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-10-23T11:18:58+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/10/99-days.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of time, as we are still in the getting-it-all-ready madness.

project done. Though I still need to finish testing it, it looks like its all
good. I had spent all yesterday developing the equations in Maple. I wont bore
you with the math but there sure was a lot of it. I ended up with 3 full pages
of math Luckily with some export and text replacement I could incorporate it
into my python code. Then came the real hard part I end up with an equation
with my variable to the power of 8. Apparently there is no closed form
solution for equations with a power greater then 4. Which leaves me with
numerical technique. If your thinking what the? well your where I was this
morning. Luckly google saved the day. What on earth did I do before google.
There are ways to solve this given a range of numbers to look at, or a
starting estimate. Both of which I could give. Scipy has some implementation
to do that. So that was finally done. Now that I can find in focal length Y
value, I finally could complete the whole calibration on the fly. Amazing how
two days of head scratching and math can be summed up by a few lines. Then
Paula got home, we had diner and I got IMed to come play some wow, which I

tried to do anything. In the meantime my girlfriend surfed to the beach and
came to the pier. I got slamed on the rocks there but i made it out finally,
board intact. I was less intact. My legs looked like i walked through a barb
wire, and my hands didn't look much better, i got to the beach and colapsed
there, so tired i couldn't move. After 10 minutes i got my breath back. I was
willing to wait for my girlfriend while she surfed, but she didn't feel like
it anymore, needles to say neither was I. The most weird thing about all of
this is i really am looking forward to surfing again. Only this time i think
ill avoid any piers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sport"></category></entry><entry><title>Pownce</title><link href="//2007/07/pownce.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-18T16:01:57+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/07/pownce.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday i got an invite to pownce. I have heard a lot about it both good and
bad, so i was really curious about it. I got in, full of enthusiasm and i came
across the first barrier in social network sites, you need friends in that
site to actually be able to enjoy it. So i looked around a bit, but i couldn't
really do much with it. I am "the computer guy" amongst my friends, so I don't
really think I will get to really do something with it unless it becomes main
stream like facebook did. It does look lovely and its a good boost for me as i
am learning django at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Great race, shame about Rossi</title><link href="//2007/07/great-race-shame-about-rossi.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-15T16:15:53+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/07/great-race-shame-about-rossi.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The motogp in germany today was just brilliant. Great action on all three
races. On the 125 The battle was for second and third. 250 was a brilliant
race all the way with a great finish. It was good to so Lorenzo not win a
race, which makes the championship a lot more interesting. The motogp race was
great, but i can't help and feel bad about. Yes I'm a Rossi fan, Yes I
probably most people are, but I think its good for the championship to have a
close race to the world championship.  Right now it looks like only Rossi is
can threat Stoner. Stoner now has a 32 point lead which is very solid, Will be
hard for Rossi to try and make this interesting. Pedrosa was amazing, he won
witha hugh lead on a very difficult race. Capirrosi rounded up the podiumwith
a strong second. It was good to see Hayden getting back to his old self. He
start 14, he finished third. Very impressive.  Next week is laguna beach,
where Hayden is very strong. Maybe we will get something of what was expected
this season a Rossi-Hayden-Pedrosa fight.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sport"></category></entry><entry><title>wxPython</title><link href="//2007/07/wxpython.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-14T21:09:50+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/07/wxpython.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am now busy making the GUI for my camera calibration tool. I have chosen to
use wx for the GUI. So far it has been nice to use. the documentation is quite
good and the development is going nicely. It does have some weird things. I
had a problem creating things at time if i try to set them to a variable, but
work fine when i just declare them. My biggest problem has been creating a
window with a scroll bar. that should be that hard, but for some reason I cant
get it to work. My ScrolledWindow just refuses to show up. So i had settled
for scaling down the images to fit the display panel. Seeing as the GUI is not
the main issue for the unversity it will have to do for now&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding some images</title><link href="//2007/07/adding-some-images.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-07-12T22:06:33+02:00</updated><author><name>Kfir Breger</name></author><id>//2007/07/adding-some-images.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished installing and setting up Gallery.

just about everything i need. I am not abandoning my django project, but it

there was an image above the image that was not found. It turned out there is
