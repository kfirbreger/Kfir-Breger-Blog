Today received my TikTok / LunaTik via the mail. When I donated to it at kickstarter, the project was not yet fully financed. It eventually turned to be the most successful project kickstarter has managed.

As I donated $70 I got the LunaTik and the TikTok. Inside were two boxes for the two arm bands. The iPod nano I ordered a week ago and was ready for insertion.

The LunaTik was what I was after, but I did take the time first to see how the TikTok looked like. I think it looks really good with the red nano.

It was time to build the LunaTik. I laid all the parts in ready

Putting it all together was quite easy and took about two minutes.

And here it is at full glory. I absolutely adore it. The design is brilliant, the material feels good and overall it feels like a quality product. Definitely a thumbs up.
