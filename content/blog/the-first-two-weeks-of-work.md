It has now been two weeks since I started working so I figured it might be a
good time for a post about how things are. Before I started working all I
heard from the working people is how they miss the student time. How much more
demanding working life is. It won't be an overstatment to say I went to my
first day a bit worried. My first day was like Christmas.Â  I got a mobile
phone, a laptop and a car. And that was pretty much it. The next two days have
been just as nice. Together with all the people who started working for
Getronics-Pinkroccade this month we had a 2 day into plan. Some presentation,
some group talks, and beer. Yes every building in the company has its own beer
tap with a barman. I like that. Did I mention, its free beer? The people I met
were intellegent, interesting and fun. If this is how most people in the
company are, I made a good choice coming to work here. From the forth day on,
and for the coming 2 weeks I'm in courses in Amersfoort. Its quite relaxed.
I'm doing the courses alone, with a tutor I can turn to for questions. My
tempo is quite high (im going almost at twice the expected rate) so I might be
finished earlier then expected. After I finish the courses I have a month of
stage to build some web app (interesting ideas for what exactly are welcome).
Then it will be time to actually work on real projects.
