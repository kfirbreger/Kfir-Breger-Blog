Last weekend A few of us from WV Het Stadion had a weekend mountain biking in Malmedy, Belgium. Its a beautiful place to ride and home to my(any many others) favorite ardennen marathon, the [rdhf](rdhf.be).

Saturday, over breakfast, we got the trails map out and looked for what looked interesting. Throughout the Ardennen there is a grading system for trails going from 1 to 3 for both physical and technical. We found a trail rates 3 physical and 2 technical which was only 20% on asphalt 12km from Malmedy. We decided not to take the road, which was shortest but to use the network of trails in the area to come by the trail via other trails, starting by Malmedy. We figured it will be about 2 hours going there, then 2 hours for the trail and then 2 hours back. In Mountain biking however, things don't always go according to plan.

After 10 minutes we cam across a small bridge. Crossing it caused two snake bites. Half an hour later we were moving again, only to stop 30 seconds later and rework one of the two. By the time we were rolling again it was an hour since we left. A few km later we had to stop again because some screws were loose on another bike. Then there was another flat, and another. It was getting ridiculous. Almost all the flats were on the same bike. By the third time we decided to take a very close look at the tire and found a thorn stuck in it. Removing it and fixing the flat got us a few km further before another flat, and a second thorn. Then I crashed.

We were going really fast on a muddy descent. Mud is a weak spot of mine, so I decided to push hard. Only way to learn is to try. My tire was looking like a mud disc when it lost grip. The bike just slid under me and I slipped on the mud. It should not have been such a painful fall but it was. I must have slammed my shoulder against something because it still hurts a lot.

Finally we got to the trail we were after and it was sweet. Technically interesting and physically challenging. Of course we had 2 more flats. By now it was getting late and so we decided to head back home. Via a trail if possible and otherwise via asphalt. We left our wonderful trail and took another. The tea, was getting a bit tired so we took the asphalt route. After a few minutes on it, Marijn looked back and said to me, "The train is coming", while he started to accelerate. I was thinking, "Train? On asphalt?" I looked back and saw a road cyclist coming our way quite fast. "ahh, that train" So I stood on the pedals and join the fun. We were descending and the road cyclist was doing a great job so we could go really fast. Once the next climb came, I had to drop out. Marijn kept with him for a few more k's before dropping as well. We all met at the top of the hill which just happen to be next to the best fries restaurant in the area. We earned those fries.

The next day we took the cars to the start of the trail we wanted. We were going to ride it all the way today. And so we did. It was awesome. Great descents, lots of flow and speed with roots and rocks for extra fun.  Difficult, steep  climbs pushing your abilities both physical and technical. Beautiful landscape. It was the good life. The technical mishaps of yesterday didn't come this time around and we had very little technical problems so we could ride. We finished the trail feeling totally stoked. This is going to be a regular training  ride, we all agreed.
