Yesterday i got an invite to pownce. I have heard a lot about it both good and
bad, so i was really curious about it. I got in, full of enthusiasm and i came
across the first barrier in social network sites, you need friends in that
site to actually be able to enjoy it. So i looked around a bit, but i couldn't
really do much with it. I am "the computer guy" amongst my friends, so I don't
really think I will get to really do something with it unless it becomes main
stream like facebook did. It does look lovely and its a good boost for me as i
am learning django at the moment.
