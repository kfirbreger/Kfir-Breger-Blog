I am now busy making the GUI for my camera calibration tool. I have chosen to
use wx for the GUI. So far it has been nice to use. the documentation is quite
good and the development is going nicely. It does have some weird things. I
had a problem creating things at time if i try to set them to a variable, but
work fine when i just declare them. My biggest problem has been creating a
window with a scroll bar. that should be that hard, but for some reason I cant
get it to work. My ScrolledWindow just refuses to show up. So i had settled
for scaling down the images to fit the display panel. Seeing as the GUI is not
the main issue for the university it will have to do for now.
