I came across this site today. they create some nice graphic maps. For example
this map [shows](http://http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/history-of-religion.html)
the development of religions in the world. Its funny that Judaism is shown,
but non of the religion of central or south america which were probably a lot
larger, though they don't exist anymore, at least not in any real numbers.
