Over at Bicycling magazine there is a piece about [self
massaging](http://www.bicycling.com/training-nutrition/injury-prevention/self-massage-cyclists) for both pre and post riding. A few years ago, when I was
doing a lot of rock climbing, I got in the habit of doing self massaging
before starting a climbing session. It has proven to be a very good way to not
only improve my climbing on the session but also reduce injury and pain after
the session. I am curious to see if this has the same effect on my mountain
biking. It is certainly worth a try.
