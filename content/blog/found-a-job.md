In a streak of luck and some good talks, I got a job at
[Pinkroccade](http://www.getronicspinkroccade.nl/). I will be following the
Young IT professional program they offer. Starting on the 1/3/2008. this
should give me a month to visit Israel, and have some time with my brothers in
the Netherlands before starting to work full time.
