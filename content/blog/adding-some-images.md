I just finished installing and setting up Gallery. It went quite smooth. that
1click install dreamhost has is quite nice. I even had time to set up two
small albums. the combination of WordPress, Gallery and ActivColab seems to be
just about everything i need. I am not abandoning my django project, but it
might be a good idea to try and make stuff that cant already be done :)
