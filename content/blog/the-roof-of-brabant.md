The 13 of February I rode for the first time in months a proper tour. With the
racing season coming closer by, it was a good chance to see how much all the
winter training had helped.

For the not dutch among you, Brabant is one of the provinces in the
Netherlands. This being the Netherlands means that the highest point is 60m.
Its more of a hill then anything else, although for dutch XC tracks, its
pretty high. The tour had a good mixture of technical single track and simple,
recovery flats. There were some minor climbs and descents, but aside from the
roof, nothing really big.

After all the spinning I did through the winter I was expecting to be very
fast. I wasn't. It took me just over 3 hours to finish the 50 km tour. That is
slower than I ever was. At first this really got me down. It seed that all the
training has only made me slower. After getting home and thinking more about
it I tend to think that I was so slow more thanks to the fact that it was 90%
mud more then that training has made me slow. It was also a good wake up call

Not knowingly it seems I was expecting after just 8 months of training to be
as fast as the leading group. Somehow, in my subconscious, I got myself
convinced I was already prime spot material. Quite unrealistic of me, and its
good that it surfaced now and not at an actually competition. I need, it
seems, a reminder of what my realistic expectations are for this season,
otherwise I risk getting overtrained.
