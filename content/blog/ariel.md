While I was Island hopping in Thailand I finally got some time to give Ariel,
the new album by Kate Bush a good listening. I really love it. Its clearly
Kate Bush. Her voice is as amazing as ever, and somehow better. It lost some
of its girlish quality and is a bit more rough, and sexy. The music is also
very good. If you like Kate Bush definitely listen to it. And if you don't,
give it a try. There is a lot to love there.
