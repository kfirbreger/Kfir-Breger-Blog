There is a hip Chinese restaurant jut under our hotel. It has swings for
chairs, uses lots of green color,Â  and is full of what I perceive to be young
hip Chinese people. On the menu they have tea frappuccino in different
flavours. What this basically is, is some sort of cold capuchino, in flavours,
only it has tea instead of coffee. All the hip Chinese where helping
themselves to one, so I figured I'd go with the flow. What can I say. Some
drinks are meant to be coffee based. No amount of hipness is worth the taste
of sour green tea, mixed with caramel followed by the after taste of
dishwasher water.
