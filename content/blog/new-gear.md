This weekend I spent a shit-load of money. Since I am going snowboarding I
figured it was time for me to get my own snowboard. Friday I visited 3 shops
but didn't find quite what I wanted. Not to mention I got very little
attention. Saturday, following Erwin's recommendation I went to a fourth shop.
After 7 hours there (poor Paula, I dragged her with me there) I left with a
shinning new board. The head of the snowboarding department there, Ed, gave me
all the attention, asked all the questions and tuned everything exactly to my
need. I ended up paying 100 Euro more then other places, but for that service
and that precise tunning it was well worth it. Sunday morning I went
snowboarding for 2 hours and man oh man. It was amazing. Never have I had such
an experience on a board. The faster I went, the better the board felt.
Everything felt right. The board was hard enough to carve really well, but
still communicate when I was nearing the limit. It was quick to react but very
stable. Stuff I couldn't pull off before I was doing now with confidence. It
was just an amazing experience. I can't wait to get to the real pistes this
weekend! For the gearheads here are the details on my new set: Snowboard:
