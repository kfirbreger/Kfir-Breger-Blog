The last few days I have been making great progress on my thesis. Things are
finally starting to fall into their place and the pace is great. I managed to
solve some weird problems and I am now at the point where the difference
between the calculated and the measured matrix is practically zero. that is,
when projecting using the both matrices, the relation between both projections
is 1.00008, which is great. Also while projecting i get a max of 2.3 pixel
error and an average of 0.8 which is totally acceptable for such an early
stage. All this advancement sure makes me feel good. Not that I intend to keep
going with the University. It's been enough for now, I really am looking
forward to doing some more projects. Which brings me to Joost. Still no word
from them. I guess its normal, I should expect a week or two, but I really
would like to know if i get a shot at working for them. the more i think of
it, the more I like the idea. I guess Ill just have to wait and see. And now
its time for me to get back into my Kruppa's equation explicit form
development. which is the last thing I still need to program.
