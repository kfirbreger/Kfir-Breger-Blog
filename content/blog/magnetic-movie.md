The secret lives of invisible magnetic fields are revealed as chaotic ever-
changing geometries . All action takes place around NASA's Space Sciences
Laboratories, UC Berkeley, to recordings of space scientists describing their
discoveries . Actual VLF audio recordings control the evolution of the fields
as they delve into our inaudible surroundings, revealing recurrent â€˜whistlers'
produced by fleeting electrons . Are we observing a series of scientific
experiments, the universe in flux, or a documentary of a fictional world?.
