Yesterday I read on Shawn Blanc's excellent blog about his [hybrid](http://shawnblanc.net/2015/06/hybrid/) solution to task management. Like me, he enjoys using a notebook for task management, but also sees the big advantages of having a digital system (Shawn is a big [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) user). Shawn came up with a hybrid system to combine the two, which seems really smart, so I decided to try it out.

Like Shawn, I was using a digital task management tool, [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/). I was also using the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com) system for my notebook. Combining the two was difficult for me and I could not find a system that worked naturally. For a few days now I have been using Shawn's system and it is working really well. Not only am I getting more things done per day, but I also feel more calmed and less overwhelmed by everything that needs to get done each day.
