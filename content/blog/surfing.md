I went surfing yesterday for the first time in a very long time. I never
really was a surfer but I figured hey, its a board, and i snowboard and i have
skateboarded, cant be that hard. Last time i tried was in Tenerife and there
were pretty big waves there, so I was mostly peddling and trying to get to a
spot where I could catch some waves. This second time was even worse. I went
with my girlfriend to Scheveningen And after about 5 min I got stuck in a
strong pull towards a rocky pier. I was peddling for about 30 min without
moving an inch till i decided I should try and make for the pier before I'm to
tried to do anything. In the meantime my girlfriend surfed to the beach and
came to the pier. I got slamed on the rocks there but i made it out finally,
board intact. I was less intact. My legs looked like i walked through a barb
wire, and my hands didn't look much better, i got to the beach and colapsed
there, so tired i couldn't move. After 10 minutes i got my breath back. I was
willing to wait for my girlfriend while she surfed, but she didn't feel like
it anymore, needles to say neither was I. The most weird thing about all of
this is i really am looking forward to surfing again. Only this time i think
ill avoid any piers.
