If your like me you like you vinyl records. To me there are some pieces of
music which just don't sound right without a certain background noise that
only vinyl can make. The guys at the Apple Blog have a post about [how to rip
vinyl records into Apple lossless](http://gigaom.com/apple/ripping-vinyl-to-24bit-96khz-apple-lossless/). Quite useful for getting that vintage vinyl
feeling on your digital music player.
