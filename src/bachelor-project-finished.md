Finally, and after about 1.5 years of delays, bad luck, and lack of
motivation, my bachelor project is complete, done with , finished. Two days
ago I gave a presentation and got the grade. 7.5 If you must know. Most
important is this feeling of relief I know feel. This project has been a stone
hanging on my neck, dragging me down. Now that its finished I feel so light,
so happy. Now its time to find a job, get some down to earth work, and also,
start working on all these projects I have in my head. I'm gonna start with
combining my project, the calibration, with Yuri's project, the 3d
reconstruction, to make a complete program.Â  And I think the next move would
be to make something like skitch, only free, and eventually combine it with
the reconstruction tool, maybe And also implement the new resizing method.
Lots of plans. But firs of, a party, because tonight Paula and me are going to
a wedding.
