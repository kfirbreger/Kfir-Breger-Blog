My road bike is a 15 year old Jan Janssen. Which is fine if all you do is commute to your work and back. Next year though I am planning on doing a triathlon and do some serious road bike races. It was therefore time for an upgrade. Since I was looking for something that would work for both a tri and a road race, the Cervelo Soloist seemed like the perfect fit. And so after looking around the internet I found this wonderful, never used frame. The project can begin
