My feet hurt. Bad. I needed to get that out of the way. Now for the fun Part. The dutch railway have a hiking project. They have set up hiking routes that start, and end in their stations. The initiative is good. It offers people with little experience in hiking and/or people with no car to go about doing some pretty good hiking.As I have not hiked in quite some time we decided to take a route of medium length. 18km total. Should be doable. And it was. But our feet. Man our feet hurt. The views were really nice as you can see in the next few pictures.

We had a wonderful time walking together in the country. listening to the birds, walking through villages. It was all very relaxing. We couldn't stop smiling all the way back home.
