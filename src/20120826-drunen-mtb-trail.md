With the NYC trip behind me it was time to focus back on mountain biking. Looking at Strava i was disappointed to see just how little cycling I have done since the RDHF. I just had to cycle again. some friends of mine dropped the name Drunen. I have never ridden that trail before so I decided to try it. Marijn decided to join me and so this morning we putted the bikes in the car and drove there.

We knew the weather will not be to pleasant. Unfortunately, the weather turned out to be far worse then we expected. There we were at the start of the trail, siting in the car, while its raining hard outside. Took us five minutes of self persuasion to get out of the car and get on the bikes.

As is usually the case as soon we started cycling the rain has almost completely stopped. Nit that we stayed dried. The trail has turned into mud and puddles, some the size of small pools. I was enjoying myself. How i missed this. The trail itself is pretty flat, even for the Netherlands. The climbs en descents that are in the trail are mostly technical. This is actually quite a good place to train some basic technical skills.

My body was feeling the lack of training. Marijn was flying on the trail effortlessly while I was working hard, going red at times, just to keep up. I have a lot of work ahead of me.

The harsh trail condition was making short work of our brake pads. After half an hour our breaks were feeling quite week. A quarter of an hour later my rear brake and Marijn's front brake just stopped working. After an hour of cycling we were barely able to break. We decided to skip the second round. The ability to brake is something we consider crucial for mountain biking.
We were nearly at the en of the route when the weather turned again.

The rain came fast and hard. Within twenty seconds We were completely wet. A small storm was passing us, thunder and all. As true mountain bikers we just kept going. Once your completely soaked, your soaked, so you might as well keep going. We cycled through that rain for ten minutes before reaching the end of the trail. As soon as we reached the car the rain ceased. Two minutes later the sun came out. We changed and  settled at the cafe for a well earned cup of coffee and an apple tart.

The Drunen trail is fun. There are short technical climbs and descents and the scenery is beautiful. It is however no something out of the ordinary for the Netherlands. If you never rode it, it is worth a visit, or if you want something different it is worth dropping by.
