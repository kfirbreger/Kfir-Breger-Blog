Not a lot of time, as we are still in the getting-it-all-ready madness. This
last week has been all about preparations, and we are still hard pressed to
finish everything. One way or another in a few hours Paula and me will be
sitting in the plane, heading to the far east, and what we didnt get done,
well nothing to do about it. The first day in our 99 day exploration of the
east.
