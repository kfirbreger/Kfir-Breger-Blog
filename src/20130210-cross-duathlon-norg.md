Title: Cross Duathlon Norg

The winter here is to cold for swimming and so I was going to try duathlons as an alternative to triathlons. Its definitely not the same but it is as close as I can get. Its a good way to learn transition which at least partially (bike to run) is identical to triathlon. A cross duathlon was even more up my alley as it involved mountain biking instead of road biking. And so I found myself heading to Norg, a 2 hours drive, for my first ever multisport event.

The race had two loops. A running loop and a mountain bike loop. The running loop is 1.5km long and the mountain bike loop is 5km long. The race is 4 running loops (6km) followed by 4 mountain bike loops (20km) and then finishing with two more running loops(3km). I figured I can do this in 2 hours in my current state and so set that as my target time[^1].

I arrived about 40 min before the start, got my start number and changed. Something I noticed in the dressing room was that the racers here had a belt around their waste. The belt is used to hold your number. This is useful not only for protecting your clothing from needle holes, but also to shift the number to the back when you are on the bike. I got into the transition area and tried to decide where would be the best place for me to place my bike. I figured that taking as straight a line as possible through the transition area should be the best line. I placed my bike accordingly, putting my helmet and shoes on the far side from where I expected to come. By this time it was 5 min to start. Damn, there would be no warming up. I jogged a bit until we were called to the start line to get ready.

I had no idea how fast people start on these events so I placed myself at the back of the pack and a little to the side. If I am faster, ill pass people easily enough on the side, and if I am not faster, well I’m at the back anyway. The start sign was more a yell then a shot, which was kinda sweet, and reflects the small and friendly nature of this race. The start went pretty good and within seconds I already passed a few people. I looked at my watch, I was already almost at zone 4. “Start anxiety” I told myself. I was keeping pace with the lead group and it felt good. I did have to let them go though as I was trying to stick to the plan. I failed and spent most of those 6km going to hard. Still people were slowly passing me.

Finishing the run and getting on the bike took 1 min. Not fast, but not bad for my first transition ever. Getting on the bike felt great. “I know this” was echoing in my head. Even though I was still going hard I was more relaxed. The mountain bike loop was a good mixture of short technical passes with rolling hills and lots and lots of single tracking. Passing was tricky in most parts of the loop. Normally thats not really an issue for me but here, I was passing people regularly. I was passing people and that felt good. I know I am not racing the other people[^2] but hey, who doesn’t enjoy this? Close to the end of the fourth and final lap my stomach started hurting so I decided to skip the last gel. I entered the transition area running, set the bike in its place, switched shoes and I was off. Again, less then a minute on transition.

In the middle of the first loop my legs started cramping badly. Skipping that last gel was a mistake. And so with cramping legs and pain in my stomach I finished the first loop. Nora and Rob have arrived and cheered me on, and that sure did help. The pain was still there but my spirits were up as I did the last loop. I even managed to sort of sprint to the finish.

It was great fun and a good experience for me. I learned a lot and I met my target time of 2 hours.

### Lessons
- Arrive more than an hour in advance
- Make the race plan a week ahead of race day
- Try better to stick to the plan
- Don’t skip your gels

Looking forward to my next race the Hilversum Duathlon next month.

[^1]: Not having run in over 2 weeks, and this being my first offroad run in years I figured a pace of 5.40 is reasonable.

[^2]: Not on my level. I am racing myself and the clock. At least I’m suppose to.
