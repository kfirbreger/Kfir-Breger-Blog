Saturday I mailed my pre-definitive version of my thesis and I am very happy
about tit. Not so much my work, which i think is ok, but that I'm almost done.
It has been so long coming and I'm finally seeing the end. After being a for
so many years in the university I'm really fed up with it. Its time for me to
do some non academic work, with some finished product to see. I love studying,
but I also like having something to show for my work. I know ill get back to
the bench, but for now its time to stop.
