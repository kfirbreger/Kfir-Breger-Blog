First race of the year. First race of the [EBMC](http://ebmc.info). I was really getting exited. Finally after all the hard work I have put in this winter I get to ride a marathon. Even though I was not able to train properly the last month and a half, I had high hopes for a good result. My intention was to average a speed of 15 km/h, which is faster then I have ever been before. I was also going to try a new breakfast strategy. No solid foods, just energy drink and a gel. This should, in theory make me conserve fluids better and have an easier start.

Our group consisted of Tim, Jurriaan, Sophia and I. Tim I knew was faster, Sophia I suspected would also be faster. Jurriaan I was not so sure. I figured he would start faster but I would catch him somewhere mid-race. The weather has turned for the better and so we were enjoying the sun getting ready for the race. A short discussion about tyre pressure (I went with 2 bar), and we headed for the start line. Tim, having a racing license was off first, We started 20 minutes later. Jurriaan was, as I expected way faster at the start, I lost him within 5 seconds. a minute in to the race, I left Sophia behind me. I decided to try something new this time. I was going to stay in zone 3 for the first hour and then increase to zone 4 for as long as I could.
