I haven't even been working on my site for a full hour and already there are
some problems with IE. I am developing on a Mac so i cant control how things
look in ie. I asked a friend of mine to look at the site and it looked like
there was an image above the image that was not found. It turned out there is
a special trick needed to make ie display png with a transperant background. I
don't know if its still true, but i have been lazy and made it with iWeb and
he generatd taht code. I will look mor einto it when i get the time.
