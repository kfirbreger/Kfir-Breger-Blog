This race was the first I was doing for a second time. Not a big surprise considering this is my second racing season. In mountain biking it is really hard to compare your performance between races. Climbing meters and distance do not tell the whole story. Even climbing angle does not. Unlike road biking. In mountain biking is the terrain a very decisive element in determining your pace. Looking at the same race is better, since you know the general course is the same. Yet, even that is not an easy comparison as the terrain can change between years. How muddy the track is for instance. Still. Its as close as you can get, which is why I was excited to finally have a chance to see my progression.

The Ardennen Trophy is the second race in the [EBMC](htp://emb.info) series. Having raced a week and a half ago at Les Cimes, I was hoping to be recovered enough to maintain my two goals for races this year(15km/h average speed and top half finish). Everybody was occupied with other races so this time I was going at it alone. That is both negative (boring) and positive (less social pressure to perform). As I said I knew where I was going. I was surprised at how much more relaxed I was at the beginning of the day, all the way up to the start. Nothing was new. I new where to pick up my number, where the start was, where to park. I wonder if this is part of the benefit of having racing experience. Starting relaxed is a feeling I like.

My plan was again, start cool, then increase the pace as you go. This time around I was better at it, staying at zone 3 for the greater part of the first hour. I was passing people left and right and my tempo was good. The weather was plaing in my favor as well. At 25 degrees I was totally enjoying myself while most european ridiers probably found it to be to warm. By the hour's end, I have covered almost 18km. I was feeling great. The next hour I was somewhat slower, but still ahead of schedule. As the race progresses, I was more and more confident that I could hit my targets. The course was noticeably more technical then Les Cimes. I figure in the EMBC they build up on the difficulty not only on the physical side but also on the technical side. I was enjoying this increase in technical difficulty. It keeps the race interesting. You can't get bored when you have to be alert or crash.

Four hours in, I was still 20 minutes ahead of my planned tempo, when things went wrong. I was on a fast technical descent and saw the gap in front of me to late to steer away. I tried to bunny hop it but didn't manage to clear it all. My rear wheel hit the rock on the other side hard. The kind of hard that you know leads to a flat. I stopped and got of the bike, just in time to hear the 'ttttttssssssssssss' coming from by rear wheel. So I did what every racer should do. I stood and cursed for a few minutes. What a waste of time. When I finally took the wheel out to replace the tire, I noticed I had broken a spoke. So again, I cursed for a few minutes before continuing. By the time the wheel as back in I had lost pretty much all of those 20 minutes. With no spare tube[^1] and a broken spoke, I had to decrease my descent tempo significantly. I still had about 30km to go, and I didn't feel like walking to the finish. I hate taking it easy on the descents, but you do what you got to do to make sure you finish.

From the last feeding station, 10 km before the finish I increased my pace. It was time to finish this race. The climb to the finish last year left me with a certain trauma it would seem. I was fearing it. Its funny because it was not really stip, neither was it long. It was the unexpected part of it that hit me so hard last year. Still I was mentally busy with it the whole last 10 km. Stupid I know. I was trying to figure out when it would come. It never did. The course was changed so it was just one long climb to the finish. When I saw that 1km sign, and saw it only goes up from here. I realized this, and the weight was off my shoulders. I man I was flying that last 1km. It felt great.

Finishing in the top half, with a time of 6:11, I fell short of the 15km/h. Still, I am happy with the result. Had I not gotten that flat, I would have made it in 6 hours, probably less. More importantly it was lots and lots of fun. What I learned:

* If you get a flat, get right down to repair it. Cursing does not help
* Not worrying about one climb or another makes your legs go faster. Keep cool.

It was time to set my focus on my first A race of the year, the [RDHF](http://rdhf.be)
