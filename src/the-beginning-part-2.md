I have already started a blog, but it was on iWeb. It offers some nice
graphics, but frankly, it just felt weird using it. So here I am again
starting over with Wordpress. the old blog is still
[here](http://kfirbreger.com/oldblog). What i would like is the dynamics of
the wyswyg of iWeb with a good CMS. I need to check making a custom theme in
wp. Might be all i wanted
