The motogp in germany today was just brilliant. Great action on all three
races. On the 125 The battle was for second and third. 250 was a brilliant
race all the way with a great finish. It was good to so Lorenzo not win a
race, which makes the championship a lot more interesting. The motogp race was
great, but i can't help and feel bad about. Yes I'm a Rossi fan, Yes I
probably most people are, but I think its good for the championship to have a
close race to the world championship.  Right now it looks like only Rossi is
can threat Stoner. Stoner now has a 32 point lead which is very solid, Will be
hard for Rossi to try and make this interesting. Pedrosa was amazing, he won
witha hugh lead on a very difficult race. Capirrosi rounded up the podiumwith
a strong second. It was good to see Hayden getting back to his old self. He
start 14, he finished third. Very impressive.  Next week is laguna beach,
where Hayden is very strong. Maybe we will get something of what was expected
this season a Rossi-Hayden-Pedrosa fight.
