Hong Kong, finally, after years of thinking of you, I'm here, to walk your
fantastic streets, amongst your people, to see you with my own eyes. I felt
like a small boy, off to his first amusement park. It is weird for me to feel
this way as I rarely get so excited about cities. Hong Kong for me was always
a name that was almost magical. That British-Chinese city in the far east. The
melting point of civilizations. And I was not disappointed. We landed here at
night. Taking the Airport express we emerged from a tunnel to view the towers
of light set against the dark sky. It was like I was riding on a Metro in the
middle of a Manga film. I still get excited as soon as I leave the hotel room,
which is on the 19 floor. I am going back into those streets now. Ill write
more about the magic I have found here after we leave.
