As I was going through youtube adding the clips for the previous post I can
upon A LOT or remixes for Dead or Alive's "You spin me round round". So much
so that I felt I had to put these 3 mixes, starting with Jessica Simpson,
which unfortunately do not allow embedding so
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe2aqYkIbXM&feature=related) it is

the next one is by Thalia. I have to say, I have no idea who she is

and finally a more straight forward remix, if you can call it that

Its amazing to see how the video clips have grown from an afterthought to a
central piece in the creation of main stream music
