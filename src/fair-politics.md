), miss information and [idea-as-facts](http://www.johnmccain.com/decisioncenter/) is not. Not to mention
playing the media. CBS did a [check](http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:Gnfnupks7CwJ:www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/04/politics/animal/main4414049.shtml+http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/04/politics/animal/main4414049.shtml&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=at&client=firefox-a) on Palin's speech.
