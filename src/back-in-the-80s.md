At work today I was listening to a classic rock station when "I ran" by A
Flock of Seagulls came up. It must have been at least 15 years since I last
heard it. So with this nostalgia in mind, here are some of those 1 hit songs
from the 80s

this post wont be complete without "You Spin Me Round"

And for a final touch

Oh the memories
