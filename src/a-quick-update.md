It has been a while since I blogged, but as we are in Phuket at the moment and
the sun calls I will just write a quick update. We spent 10 days in Malaysia,
visiting Georgetown (Penang) and Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia proved to be a very
interesting place mainly because of the people. Malaysia has many minority
groups and a few religion. Islam is the dominant religion but there are quite
a lot of Buddhist and Hindu temple. We also saw some Daoist temples. The
distinct feeling in Malaysia is for people who are looking for an identity.
With a lot of minority groups and religion there is no clear feeling of unity
there. Kuala Lumpur proved to be a shopping haven. There are a lot of shopping
centers there are a few new ones being built. All in all Malaysia was an
interesting, but not spectacular experience. Moving back to Thailand we
settled in Phuket's Kata beach, where we will stay until the 25. Its time to
get some color before heading back to the cold. On the 25 we will take a night
bus to Bangkok. On the 28 at night we have our flight back to the Netherlands.
See you all soon!
