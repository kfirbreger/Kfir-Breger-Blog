Web2.0 has been used as a hype word for so long now it has reached, at least
for me, the status of somewhere between "handle with care" and "just stay
clear of". So when i heard about traineo, a web2.0 site that helps you manage
your sport, weight and diet, I was very skeptical.One month later, i just
realized I am hooked on this site. I have tried more then one site that
attempted some of these tasks, mostly performance and training logbooks, non
of them were good enough for me to stick with. I don't know what it is about
traineo, but i think it just does everything I wanted, and does it well, and
it looks great to boost. The idea of the motivators is also a brilliant idea,
and you know what? it actually works. I strongly suggest you to [check it
out](http://www.traineo.com)
