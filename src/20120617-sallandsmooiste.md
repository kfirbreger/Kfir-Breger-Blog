Its good to have friends to ride with. In increases the fun of the ride exponentially, its fun to talk about the ride afterwards, and also, it helps you in finding new rides. This was the case with Sallands Mooiste. For the non dutch, Sallands is a nature reserve area on the east of the Netherlands. It's quite beautiful, and, important for mountain bikers, not flat. Marcelo picked up that there was a mountain bike tour being organized there. Normally most of the area is off limit to mountain bikers so this was a great chance to ride in a lot of places you normally wouldn't be allowed to (which is to me always part of the allure of races and tours). With the added bonus of being able to sleep at a relative's right next to the start this was looking very promising.

Saturday evening we arrived, and took the bikes for a spin to check out the area. Even though it has been raining a lot the last few days, the area seemed pretty dry. Our fears of a mud fest were put to rest. We got back, had some carbo-loading evening meal and went to bed. The next day we got up quite early, and even though the start was only 10km away took the car. 10km is a great warmup before an event. However, coming back might not be that much fun. The start was well arranged. This was clearly a tour and not a race. There was no time measuring, no big start and finish bow. I noticed I missed some of the excitement you get from a race. Am I turning into a real racer?

We started off at an easy pace. The idea was to go easy the first 30 minutes, get nice and warm, and then go somewhat faster for half the distance, hammering it the last half. It has been a while sinds I rode with Marcelo so I was not sure how are riding speed compared. I took lead and start off at an easy pace. As I noted before, all that training (Thanks [Jurriaan](http://twitter.com/bikkelpunten)) has started to show an effect and so I was not sure how I compare to Marcelo. As the first hour progressed, I noticed I was stronger then Marcelo so I was keeping it to mostly an easy pace. We wanted to hold to the 20km/h, and so I tried to make sure we were just above it. The paths were wide open and we were surrounded by beauty. The first climb I hammered on the pedals, and we regrouped at the top of the climb, then it was a fun fast decent. Then we lost the path.

We were riding on the dirt path next to the paved bicycle road. If you go mountain biking, you should pick as much dirt as you can. At least that is how I look at it. Anyway, the  turn was only marked from the bicycle path and so we missed it. Luckily we came across another group that was heading back because they also missed it, and so it only cost us a little bit of time. After a few more minutes in the open we got into the woods. The route was chosen quite well, zigzagging through a lot of single tracks, and small paths. After just a little over an hour of riding we got the the feeding station. The local band was planing there (nice touch) and there was some food and drink. What I did see for the first time was food that was offered for sale. those apple cakes looked quite good, but we had no money with us, so we had to settle for our Power Bars.

The second hour was even more fun. The singletracks got a bit more technical, there were more climbs, and overall it had almost an Ardennes feeling to it. I was hammering it on the climbs and descends, just having a good time enjoying the ride. It took us a bit more to finish the second 20km, By the time we left for the last 15 km, we were busy for two and a half hours. We did get to hear by the second stop that the idea for next year is to have a combo road and mtb tour. Saturday a road ride, followed by the MTB on the sunday. Both Marcelo and I really liked the idea. about 3 km before Haarle we got out of the woods and into open farmland. Just before entering Haarle there was  nice touch. A ramp ridding up to the back of a truck, with a staircase descent on the other side of the truck that led to what is normally a horse obstacle course. You had to go through 2 of the horse obstacles. From there it was half a km to the finish. We putted the bikes down and chilled for a few minutes before heading home after a very fun and successful day. See you all next year.
