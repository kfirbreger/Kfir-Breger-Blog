It has been over a year since the last time I went for a run. It was never
really my favorite sport, and once I started cycling, there really was no
point to it. Since I am on a bike break, I figured I would go for a jog. I
didn't go fast nor far but somehow ended with real muscle pain. I would have
thought all that cycling would have helped, but it seems there really is a big
difference here.
