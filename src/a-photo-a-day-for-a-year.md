A few days ago I came upon this idea and I really liked it. Each day, one photo, with one or two sentences, for a whole year. It helps you remember each and every day in that year, while making you a better photographer. I found this picture to be a good starting picture. Yesterday I was feeling down about loosing two ships in Eve-online Today, I am celebrating this world, and starting on what I believe to be a great experiment in living.
