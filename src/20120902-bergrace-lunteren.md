Last year I dis not enjoy the Bergrace series. I rode the first two, Wageningen and Arnhem, and disnt enjoy it. Generally speaking I do not enjoy riding laps. And when combined with low technical level its just plain boring.

Still, after watching [Velozine's course video](http://www.velozine.nl/2012/08/10/video-parcoursverkenning-bergrace-lunteren/) and talking with Marijn, who raced that course before, I decided to race. Not so much race as ride the course. Missing a lot of training the last two months meant I was not very fit.

We arrived to late to do a full warmup lap so we cycled to one of the notorious short and steep descents this course has. It really was a tough one. Coming out of a sharp right there is small drop followed by steep, deep sand, descent. It was tough. I got about 10 meters down before loosing control falling. During the race i was not able to make this descent once.

The start was delayed by about 20 minutes so everybody ended up rising circles next to the start area. Finally we were called in. There was the usual pushing as people tried to force their way to the front. I don't get why people do that. If you want to start at the front, get a racing license. The start signal was given, follows by the electrical tock orchestra as everyone around me started their gps systems.

The start went fine. I kept telling myself to stick to zone 3 for the first half hour. And as always I totally failed to listen. 1 minute in I was already into red. I got to see Marijn for a few seconds. I wont see him again until the end of the race.

Even though I knew I was going to fast, I didn't slow down. The excitement of all the racing people around me was to much for my mental control. The course was everything promised. Technical, challenging and exciting. I was working hard but progress was slow. Shortly after starting the second lap I was passed by the leader. For the rest of the lap a few more people passed. I noticed I was going slower and my legs really started to hurt. By lap 3 the amount of people lapping me has greatly increased, together with the pain in my legs.

It was frustrating. I was pushing myself very hard and yet I was lapped by people regularly. Then, near the end of lap 3 i was lapped for the second time by the leader, followed by heavy cramps in my legs. It hurt to walk. It hurt more to cycle. Still I finished the lap hoping I didn't have to go another one. 

Unfortunately, I did. I got all of 300m into the fourth lap when I hit the first climb and my legs exploded. I could cycle, walk, stand, sit or any other body position. It just hurt as hell. After a few minutes the pain got back down to tolerable levels and I could walk back to the start area. I was done. My first ever DNF because of physical breakdown.

Funny thing is, I'm happy with that. You see, I finally got to the point where I could push myself to the limit. I never quite managed to until now. I always kept something in reserve, not collapsing on the finish line. Looking back at my heart rate data, my average is just a little under my lactic threshold. I never ever raced so close to it. Now all I need to do is get fast, the not easy part is under control.
