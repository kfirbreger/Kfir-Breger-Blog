There are few places in the world who's name alone is inspiring. The Angkor
Wat is definitely one of those places. After spending 3 days there I can
completely understand why. Angkor, the old capital of the Khmer empire is a
huge complex. Its about 40 km from the north most temple ruins to the south
most. In this big area there are hundreds of temples, the most known, and the
biggest is the Angkor Wat. It is quite hard to grasp just how immense it is.
Unlike churches, it does not have one big hall. To understand how big it is
one has to be standing outside it. As we understand it is the biggest religion
building in the world. The first two days in the Angkor we spend on bicycle,
visiting the more central located temples. Aside from the Angkor Wat we
visited the Bayon in Angkor Thom, Pre Rub, and some more less known temples.
On a third day we took a TukTuk (3 wheeled taxi) for some temples that were
far of. The Angkor really grows on you. In the end of the third day we had a
hard time saying goodbye. It is hard to explain in words just how magical the
place feels. Walking in ancient temples, some reclaimed by man, some are still
covered in jungle, you can completely loose yourself.
