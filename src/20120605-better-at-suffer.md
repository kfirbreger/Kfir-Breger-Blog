Title: Better at suffering

I need to get better at opting out of suffering. Today I did a pretty intensive power training. For 6 minutes going from zone 4/5a to 5b followed by a 3 min rest and repeat. The first round was painful. At the end I was not only in pain, I was suffering. After the 3 minutes rest I was mentally not strong enough to start again. I got up mid zone 4 but then broke and went back down to  zone 2. Feeling crappy about being weak which is counterproductive. After a few minutes I decided to man up and go for another go. I got another 6 minutes of suffering. And only barely managed to scratch the mid zone 5. I was to busy suffering to actually notice.

At the end of the training I was really unhappy. I didn't manage to execute the training well, I had suffered and I felt mentally weak. Looking back at it all, it's mostly the suffering part that hinders me. Accepting pain and not suffering would have had a smaller mental load on me which would have translated to better execution of the training.
