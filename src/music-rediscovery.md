I got an LP from Joni Mitchel, Wild things run fast, from my father a few days
ago. the name was known to me but i couldn't really come up with any song that
I could connect with the name. I was so surprised when i played it, I knew
each song there , some of them i could actually sing along some parts. I guess
im having a rediscovery of Joni Mitchell period coming up
