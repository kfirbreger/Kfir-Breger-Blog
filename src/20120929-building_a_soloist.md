Title: Building a Soloist

It was time to start looking for the rest of the parts. My budget was very tight and so I turned to [marktplaats](marktplaats.nl) which is the dutch ebay.

I knew I wanted Campagnolo. My current road bike has a 15 year old Campagnolo Athena. Even it has been used a lot in those 15 years , summer and winter, it still runs like a dream. That kind of quality is what I want. Problem is Campagnolo and low budget do not mix all that well.

Marcelo had a cassette, chain, stem and handlebar I could buy from him cheap. So that left a group, saddle and wheels. I was getting frustrated at about the Campagnolo second hand prices and was considering buying Shimano[^shim]. Following some advice on twitter, I decided to check what  [EPBike](epbike.com) had.

Eric, the owner, not only has lots of stuff, he is also a great guy, which always more fun buying stuff from. I called him up and sure enough he had an old Campagnolo Record group I could get from him on the cheap. It is a 9 speed version, so I would guess pre 2000 but hey its Campa, and its Record, which is totally awesome. It did came with a Shimano Dura-Ace crank, but I don't mind because its Shimano top of the line crank, and I want to eventually get some Rotor crank anyway. It was time to get some wheels.

I saw two possibilities on marktplaats. A barely used set of [Fulcrum Racing 5](http://www.fulcrumwheels.com/en/collection/road/alu/products/racing-5) and a somewhat more used set of [Campagnolo Zonda](http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/wheelsdetail/item_Zondacop_catid_10.jsp). The Zonda were more expensive so I decided to go for the FR5. Unfortunately, after I mailed the seller, they were taken of Marktplaats and I had no way of contacting the seller again. The Zonda it is, I decided. Only they were also gone from Marktplaats. I couldn't find anything else that was good, and cheap enough for me. My break came when [Bike-Components](bike-components.de) [^bc] had a sale on last year's FR5. So I bought that. And of course, even though I was planning on putting on an old saddle I bought a new one (Also on sale by Bike-Components). Finally for tires I went with [Schwalbe Ultremo ZX](http://www.schwalbe.com/gbl/en/produkte/race/produkt/index.php5?flash=0&ID_Produktgruppe=46&ID_Produkt=245&ID_Land=38&ID_Sprache=2&ID_Einsatzbereich=11&tn_mainPoint=Produkte&tn_subPoint=Race). With everything in-house, the plan was made. I will go Marcelo and together we will build the bike then cycle the 55km back to my place. It will be a great way to test the bike and see if anything needs adjusting.

Saturday morning we got to work. First in was the bottom bracket. I have never done that before and for some reason was nervous. Its actually quite easy. Just screw it in basically. We attached the crank, derailleurs and brakes. Next came the stem and handlebar and the saddle. The last quick step was sliding the shifters on. Even though the bike looks like a bike by now, the hard part was ahead of us.

Cables time. That is always the most time consuming part. Not only routing tje cables but also tuning the brakes and derailleurs. Routing was proven to be harder then we thought. The Soloist has routing through the tubes. Its beautiful and aerodynamic. Its also tricky. After 30 minutes of failing to get the rear derailleur cable to stick out at the bottom I called Tim, whom I knew has built a Cervélo S2, for advice. He had a tip about making a hook and use it to pull out the cables and it worked quite well. Running the brake cables proved  to be easy.

 Marcelo has lot of experience setting the brakes and derailleurs and it showed. It took him a little over 5 minutes to have everything setup just right. Shifters were working perfectly, and the brake was firm with lots of feel to it. And so, we finished it up by taping the handlebar.

 There it was. My new, awesome, Cervélo Soloist Team. The ride back home was a delight. I was accelerating way faster then my old bike, and keeping high speed was very easy. No adjustments were needed, everything was just setup perfectly. I can't wait to spend the coming months covering lots of km's with it.

[^shim]: I have nothing against Shimano. They make great gear. I run them on my mountain bike and love it. I just like Campagnolo more for road bikes.

[^bc]: Great shop, I can only say positive things about them.
