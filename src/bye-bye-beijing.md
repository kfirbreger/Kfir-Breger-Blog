This morning (woke up at 6 am god damn it) we left Beijing and took a plane to
Xi'an. Xi'an is the old capital of China, and the resting place of the famous
terracotta army. Our first impression is very positive. The city has a nice
Muslim Quarter and like any good Muslim quarter its full of life and good
food. We tried some local dishes. They were delicious. We are now off to our
hostel's dumpling party, yummy. More later
