[![Bergrace - Off the road](/images/logo-300x34.png)](http://bergraceofftheroad.nl)It's a leather to seven when the alarm clock goes off. I am however not in need of it's alarm. I am already wide awake. Today, Sunday the 27 of march 2011, is my first race. Ever. I spent Saturday evening with Bas preparing my bike for the race. We tuned the gears, oiled everything and after some thought decide on a different tire setup. Nic for the front and Ralph for the rear. It's all dry so this should be faster. I made sure I got to bed in time so I would get enough sleep. That didn't quite go as plan. I was wide awake by the time the alarm went off. I have no idea how long I have been lying in bed fully awake and trying to relax. The ring of my alarm clock was the sound of freedom. It was time to get started. My gear was already packed so I grabbed a healthy breakfast loaded the car and was on my way. Even though I did my best to stay calm it was hard not to feel excited. At times it was positive expectation, at time a lot of fear for all sorts of horrible failure. Arriving in Wageningen I took my time getting my number board (35) changing clothes and hanging the board on my bike. In my attempt to stay calm and take it easy, I took so much time that I no longer had time for a warmup lap. Here is thus my first lesson. Taking your time is fine, but keeping an eye on the clock is just as important. Because I was one of the first to register for the race I was in the group that stone at the front. I knew I was not going to play with the insane start sprint so my start position was good, but for me not ideal. I was considering what to do to get out of the way as fast as I can when we were told one minute to start.

30 seconds, 15 seconds, And off we were. It was indeed crazy, people zipping by left and right, shoving their bikes in front of me. I couldn't resist and started sprinting as well, after about 100m I was able to reason with myself and calm down. Then I sprinted again, then slowed, and back to sprint. It went like this for about 5 min. I was no longer being passed constantly and could calm myself into a normal tempo.

Getting my head straight I focused on the trail. There was sand, lots of sand, at every corner. Good for practice but a kill for my flow. Then all of a sudden I was finished with the first round. I glance at my watch, and see I did it in just over 14 minutes. Damn that's fast I think to myself. Average was suppose to be 18 minutes. Little did I know the first round is somewhat shorter.

The round was quite nice. As expected there was very little in the way of climbing, with only one short steep climb. That is not to say that the track was flat. The track had a nice ascent and descent flow to it which wasÂ  very entertaining. Despite all the sand the the corners, i was getting more and more into a flow. Round two took me 20 minutes. After an hour I was taken in by the leading group. I was working as hard a I dared considering the time I still needed to cycle but I was slowly realizing it was not fast enough. Tried as i did i couldn't really accelerate. Whenever i tried to cycles somewhat faster i was getting really tired really quick. Looking back at my round times it took me about an hour to warm up and get comfy on the bike. Once there my time started to drop again.

 Unfortunately it wasn't enough. Just before the second hour I was taken once more by the leading group. This led to me being able to ride only 7 rounds placing me far in the back of the field. Crossing the finish line, my legs were feeling tired but my back was killing me. Might be time to switch to a fully. I ended up 204 from 245 overall and 42 from 44 in the masters +30. Considering this is my first race I guess finishing better then a fifth of the participants is quite good. Still I was hoping for more. Looking back at the result I was able to score much better if I was about a minute and a half faster each round. One thing is clear though. I need to get faster, fast. I stayed around for the 75 minutes race to cheer on Bas, Tim and Bob. Bas registered somewhat late and therefore started way in the back. He did his best to catch up with Tim and Bob. Bob however had other plans. He got a flat tire after 35 min and was out. Tim with a great finish managed to stay just ahead of Bas. While cheering my mates there was a big crash right in front of me. Two rides, and flying bicycles. Sometimes things can get ugly.


![Me and some other spectators, helping crashed riders](/images/img_4920.jpg) Using the bike to get to work is a great way for me to train. However just cycling there is definitely not enough. I need to add intervals to that ride as to improve my speed. My next race is the Kellerwald marathon, the first RWP Cup race and I plan on delivering a better result. I have three weeks to improve my speed. Here's hoping I manage to. &nbsp_place_holder;
