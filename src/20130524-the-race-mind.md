<blockquote>Many's the time I have been thinking of other things, only to snap out of it and say "Wake Up! You're in a race here!" This is natural, but you have to be aware of it and learn to stay in the moment. If your mind wanders of, so does your body. You should constantly be asking yourself questions. Are my arms relaxed? Is my face? Am I working as hard as I can? Am I breathing into my belly, or am I stopping in my throat. … There should be a regular check/feedback mechanism, wether you're in training or in a race. If you loose that continual self–assessment, before you know it your face and shoulders have tensed up, your clenching your fists and your holding your breath or gasping when you don't need to.</blockquote>

Best racing advice I ever got. Being a mountain bike marathon racer means I on the bike for a few hours during the race and I recognise that tendency to let the mind wonder off all to well. The change in my focus is so subtle that I don't notice it slowly sleeping, and all off a sudden I am thinking about what my friends will say at the finish, or groceries.

At times it can be a powerful thing to get the mind of the pain in the race and to thinking about positive happy things. It gives me energy and second wind. This however should be the result of a choice instead of letting my mind accidentally wonder there.

I'll try to keep my focus better this Sunday. Hopefully it will pen out well.
