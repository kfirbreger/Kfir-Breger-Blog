You probably heard about justice Scalia of the American supreme court saying
executing an innocent man is not unlawful because he was found guilty in a
legal trial. New findings which can acquit said innocent man, are, for justice
Scalia, no reason not not proceed with what a court has found to be just. That
may sound strange, even scary coming from a supreme court justice. The thing
is, I have seen this kind of thinking before from people who give service to
society. Sometimes they seem to loose sight of what is actually the grand
reason for them being there. They stop seeing their system as a system that
gives service to society, but that society is there so obey their wonderful
system. This I believe is exactly what happened to justice Scalia. He lost
sight of the reason he is there. To serve society. Executing an innocent man
does not do that in any way. Look at it from the other direction, and you can
see how he reasons. One must ask himself if someone who completely lost sight
of what its all about could, or should, remain in his position. For more
