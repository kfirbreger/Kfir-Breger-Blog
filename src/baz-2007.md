Saturday the Boulderen Aan Zee (Bouldering at the sea) competition took place
in Scheveningen. Ivo Paula and me went there. This is the first time for me to
be in a bouldering competition and I really liked it. The atmosphere was
great. Lots of people bouldering, and during the competition everyone cheering
the climbers on. Being on the beach probably helped a lot. It was nice and
warm, the sun was shinning. Just great. We made some pictures, which I loaded
to the gallery. the are of the final route for men and women. Also made this
film.
