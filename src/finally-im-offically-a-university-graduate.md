It seems like it took forever, but its finally finished. As of today, my
Bachelor's diploma in Informatica (computer science) isÂ  waiting for me at the
administration office of the university. Only now do I really believe that I
have actually graduated. Next step is an MBA, but I think I'll wait a year or
two first.
